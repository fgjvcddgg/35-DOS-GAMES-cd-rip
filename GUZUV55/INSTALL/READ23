       THE DUNGEON MASTER --- MAN OR MYTH?                                      Behind all the adventures of the unknown hero of the Zurkian and Ultizurkian    worlds, there is always the background presence of a remarkable character       called The Dungeon Master. And there are those who wonder if he is one and      the same as Dr. Dungeon.                                                        END                                                                             Dr. Dungeon is such a similar character. Is he also The Dungeon Master? No      one knows for sure. He seems to create worlds. Sometimes it is said he          finds them, and sends a few select adventurers to visit them.                   END                                                                             A scientist of the first order, The Dungeon Master has studied many things,     and aquired vast knoweldge over the years. He always seems to be there on       the sidelines as a kind of father image. In at least two of his quests,         END                                                                             the Guildmaster actually met him: Zurk V and Hoz I. So it would appear The      Dungeon Master occasionally visits his own worlds. He was once asked if ALL     his worlds are only creations.                                                  END                                                                             "Well", he responded. "Some are. But I'll tell you this: Maithe is real."       Then he would say no more.                                                      END                                                                             He sure is a mysterious fellow!
