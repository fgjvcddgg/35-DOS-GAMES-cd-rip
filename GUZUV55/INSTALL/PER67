Me and Jonny was      questing on level 3 once, and we saw a STRANGE sight..."                                                                STRANGE                                           "Well, I know you won'ts believe me, but we saw a great gryphon carrying a      strange POTION of some kind."

We had to RUN, you see."                                                  RUN                                               "Yea, skeletons and bats came. It was some strange quest fer sure! Anyhows,     the 'leven paces was due east of our location. Maybe ztill thar!"
