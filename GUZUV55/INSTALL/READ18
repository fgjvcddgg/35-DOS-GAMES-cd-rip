              LEVELS OF ADVANCEMENT                                              Many a quester has complained about the slow progress made in making           higher levels in the under-land. Jim Slim:                                      "I heard it goes all the way to 10, but if you pass 7 or 8, you're              probably lost and failed to find something."                                    END                                                                             Jim further added: "It takes time, but gets easier as you slowly but surely     progress. I believe the factor and speed is approximately twice as slow         as Ultizurk II."
