            THE DUNGEON MASTER'S BOOK OF TIPS                                   "You should attain at least level 3 before attempting the mad knight. Try       to complete Leomund's quests early, or at least as many as you can.             When you visit the fletcher girl, always bring as many jubjub bundles           END                                                                             as you can carry. They'll be converted to ammo in your quiver, thus freeing     up your backpack. Remember also that some of the main quest items are           hidden in nooks, so explore everywhere.                                         END                                                                             When you reach the final level, have pen and paper at hand. Mark down           everything you do, or you'll get hopelessly lost."                              FINISH
