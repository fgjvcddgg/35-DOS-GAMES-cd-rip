INTRO                                             You see a lady who reminds you a lot of a school teacher you once had.                                                                                                                                  NAME                                              "Marge, young man. Now don't you dare leave here without reading at least       one book!"                                                                                                              JOB                                               "I run the Lycaeum. It's the biggest in the land, even bigger than King Eldor's up topside. Do you wish to read?"                                                                                       BYE                                               "Just don't neglect your studies, young man!"                                                                                                                                                                                                             "Hmm. Perhaps Lord Baldwin would know more about that."                                                                                                                                                 NO                                                "Now, now! Reading's good for you. You get back and read, now!"                                                                                                                                         YES                                               She smiles. "If you read a lot, I'll give you an 'A'."
