                   SOULSBANE VS. CYCLOPS?                                       Knights and fighters have long debated the philosophical question as to what    happens when an unstoppable force like a cyclops meets another such force       like the diamond sword. Would the sword stop him?                               END                                                                             No fighter has ever gotten close enough to find out. But most agree that since  the cyclops is so slow, it is better to simply avoid him. Most warriors feel    certain the sword could get him, but break in the process.                      FINISH
