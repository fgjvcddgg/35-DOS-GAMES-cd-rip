              FIELD GUIDE TO ULTIZURK II: The Shadowmaster                      In the Arcturian star system is a red planet similar to mars. There one can     find many exotic creatures and beings. Some say that strange machines are       there which allow mind and matter to be mixed in exotic ways.                   END                                                                             If you ever journey there, make sure to pick lots of yellow herbs! The planet   has so many herbs of power, that the poor monsters don't have much chance       against some hell-bent human who thinks he's a god after eating these           END                                                                             powerful herbs, and smashing them all up. Of course, the under-land monsters    are more like the "real thing", since usually it's the adventurer who gets      smashed up. See "King Eldors' Morons" for more details.
