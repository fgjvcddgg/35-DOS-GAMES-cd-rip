           GORK IV: IT CAME FROM DOWNTOWN!                                      This is a work of speculative fiction. VERY speculative. It outlines the        adventures of a new kind of fighter: the BUM class. This bum started off        as a lazy worker, then was once again a lazy worker.                            END                                                                             Finally, he reformed somewhat, but then ultimately reverted to its              old ways. A truly imaginative work of fiction!                                  FINISH
