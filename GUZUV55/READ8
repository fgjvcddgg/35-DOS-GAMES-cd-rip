                KING ELDOR'S MORONS                                             Many who have visited the lands of Ultizurk I and II have commented on the      incredible stupidity of the monsters who live there. It has been observed       on Arcturus that the monsters seem to move randomly, without minds.             END                                                                             They will merely flit from side to side, not really going anywhere, and         never do they even leave the adventurer's range of view! As for the monsters    of King Eldors' land....                                                        END                                                                             ...well! They don't even move at all, other than to wiggle in place now and     then. One almost gets the impression that they were put there solely as a way   for some demented adventurer to gain LEVELS or something!                       END                                                                             Of course, here in the under-land things are different. Everyone knows the      monsters were here long before humans settled in. The monsters here are far     more powerful than those others. The move with intelligence and purpose.        END                                                                             And many a fighter will testify that you can't simply knock of THESE            monsters too easily! Knock off, that is.                                        END                                                                                                          --Jake Strongarm, Master-at-Arms                   FINISH
