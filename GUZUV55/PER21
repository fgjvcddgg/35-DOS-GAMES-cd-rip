INTRO                                             You see a rather whimpy-looking regal monarch.                                                                                                                                                          NAME                                              "I art Lord Henry. Henry, Lord of the 8th."                                                                                                                                                             JOB                                               "I rule the 8th LEVEL."                                                                                                                                                                                 BYE                                               "Hmm.

Henry scratches his forehead. "Hmm. I just plain forgot!"                                                                                                                                               LEVEL                                             "That's what they call it. It's just the east side of this floor level, but     many think of the floor as levels 7 and 8. ALSO..."                                                                     ALSO                                              "Rumour has it there's a ninth. You should talk to 'Ol Killer. I've never       seen a ninth level. I don't believe it. Are you here to help us?"                                                       NO                                                Henry the 8th gives you a funny look.                                                                                                                                                                   YES                                               Henry the 8th smiles. "Well, good luck. Feel free to borrow our berries.        Almost all the trees here grow berries. Well, I must get back to work."
