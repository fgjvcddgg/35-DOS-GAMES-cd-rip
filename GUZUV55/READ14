                  LEGEND OF THE SOULSBANE                                       It has been said in ancient lore that a powerful artifact called the soulsbane  can be made by a wise armorer. The soulsbane is a terribly powerful weapon      usually called The Diamond Sword. It can be constructed from a large chunk of   diamond ice, found in polar regions.                                            END                                                                             Reaching the higher polar lands is not difficult for he who knows, but the wise mountaineer will always have his grappler readied in hand like a weapon,        using the ice before him foot by foot.                                          END                                                                             Not all armorers know about this weapon, but sometimes their eyes light up at   the mention of THE DIAMOND SWORD, for a chance to make such a thing is          considered a once in a lifetime opportunity.
