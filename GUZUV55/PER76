INTRO                                             "Enough! Stop! I surrender!"                                                                                                                                                                            NAME                                              "I am Sir John! Please don't hit me any more! I'm sorry!"                                                                                                                                               JOB                                               "I was, I mean I am Lord Baldwin's Captain, of the knights. How glad I am that  you knocked SENSE back into my befuddled mind!"                                                                         BYE                                               Sir John pulls out a small pouch of powder and waves it. Three poofs are heard  in the dungeon, then poof again! And Sir John the Mad Knight is gone!                                                                                                     "Greatly I wish I could help thee with that!"                                                                                                                                                           SENSE                                             Sir John bows in profound apology. "Forgive me, sir, but I fear a great EVIL is loose within this dungeon. It had caught my mind!"                                                                      EVIL                                              "An evil beyond all others, somewhere in a mysterious RAINBOW pool."                                                                                                                                    RAINBOW                                           "I heard of it, and sought it out, intent on destroying it. Something dark and  sinister, I believe, is forming in the POOL."                                                                           POOL                                              "The pool is an ancient magical creation of long dead druids. Once again it     LIVES!" Sir John cluthces his throat and gasps.                                                                         LIVES                                             "The pool I did not find. I do not know how its rainbow waters can formeth into a creature of such gargantuan evil. It must be STOPPED!"                                                                STOPPED                                           "I reached the land of the one-eyed giants. Beware them! They too are controlledby the horror below them. I FELT the evil."                                                                             FELT                                              "It took my mind, and I staggered through Henry's area, then Melissa's. Here on level five I found I could control the Spirit Daemons. I went MAD."                                                     MAD                                               He bows again. "You, sir, have shook me back. I thank thee. I must return to    Lord Baldwin and repent my error in facing this HORROR alone."                                                          HORROR                                            "Horror indeed!" He looks around. "Behold! The daemons hath felt the might      of our battle and fled. But they'll be BACK."                                                                           BACK                                              "Yes, I fear. I no longer control them, but they were always terrible anyway."  He looks anxious to leave. "I think I need a VACATION."                                                                 VACATION                                          "Let us hope Lord Baldwin understands. If ye see me not on level one, assume I  was pardoned, and allowed topside awhile. Now then, a GIFT."                                                            GIFT                                              "Far below I foundeth three mighty items. You, sir, art more worthy than I to   possess them. I shalt HIDE them in this dungeon with some magic I have."                                                HIDE                                              "Scatter them, actually, lest those spirits return and find them. I beseech     thee to search here before thee leave. And so Master, I bid thee farewell!"
