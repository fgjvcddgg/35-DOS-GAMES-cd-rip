INTRO                                             You see a lovely young girl busy whittling a branch with a small knife. She     looks up at you and smiles, but looks down again. She seems shy.                                                        NAME                                              She glances at you for a second, then quickly says: "Losi."                                                                                                                                             JOB                                               At the mention of her labor, Losi perks up. She gives you a big smile: "I hath  a wonderful job. 'Tis one that gives me great JOY, master."                                                             BYE                                               Losi smiles at you. "Please come visit again! Yer kinda cute!" She resumes      her whittling.                                                                                                                                                            Losi looks thoughtful for a moment. "Hmm. I'm afraid I don't know much about    that. Maybe you could ask Queen Melissa."                                                                               JOY                                               "I make fine arrows out of BanBan trees. Well, until LATELY..."                                                                                                                                         LATELY                                            "We hath found a much BETTER source of wood. 'Tis stronger, and easier to       whittle."

Oh, how I WISH I had some of those branches!"                                                             WISH                                              "Well, it art just fun for me, you know...say! Maybe we couldst strike up       a DEAL of some sort."                                                                                                   DEAL                                              "With one bunch of JubJub branches, I canst make seven arrows. Bringeth me      branches, and I'll give you five arrows for each BUNCH."                                                                BUNCH                                             "I'll keep two for myself and the girls here. In future visits, just ask me     about BRANCHES, and I'll know what you mean."                                                                           BRANCHES                                          Losi jumps up anxiously: "Hast thou some JubJub branches with thee?"                                                                                                                                    NO                                                She looks a bit sad. "Oh, well, let me know if thou find any!"                                                                                                                                          KISS                                              "Ohhhhh....I wast hoping you'd ask that!" Losi jumps up and hugs you, and       gives you a big, passionate kiss. "Come visit again anytime!"                                                           YES                                               "You do? You really do? Is it really true? Lemme see!" Losi jumps in joy.                                                                                                                               I LOVE YOU                                        Losi stares at you a long moment. Suddenly, she jumps up and puts her arms      around your neck. "Oh, tell me it's TRUE! Tell me it's TRUE!"                                                           TRUE                                              Losi practically weeps in joy, hugging you tight. You feel her warm Siren's     body close against you. Losi quivers. "If only we had TIME..."                                                          TIME                                              "Nay master, the land's need is too important. We must WAIT."                                                                                                                                           WAIT                                              Losi pulls away, but keeps a tight grip on your shoulders. "I shalt make thee   a PROMISE."                                                                                                             PROMISE                                           "I shall join thee when next thou quest in our land! I shall find a way to      contact Sammy up in the LAND."                                                                                          LAND                                              "I hath heard that Sammy is training as a fighter up topside, and hopes to      join thee when next thee QUEST there."                                                                                  QUEST                                             "Yes, Sammy art a good friend of mine. We canst exchange letters. When thee     arrive on thine next quest, ask Sammy about ME."                                                                        ME                                                "Yes, just say: Losi. Then, when the time comes, I am certain Queen Melissa     wilt allow me to JOIN thee."                                                                                            JOIN                                              "Until then, my love, please REMEMBER me."                                                                                                                                                              REMEMBER                                          At those words, a sudden flash of recognition floods your mind. Could this      be....?? Losi pulls you tight: "...KISS me, my love..."
