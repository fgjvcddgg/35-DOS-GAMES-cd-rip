INTRO                                             In a building which looks much like a bank, you see a tall thin gentleman       wearing a fine silk outfit. He looks up from the documents on the desk.                                                 NAME                                              "I am William. I am the Royal Treasurer. Thou art welcome here."                                                                                                                                        JOB                                               "I keep track of the finances of the underland. Many projects need to be        financed. The ECONOMY right now is doing well."                                                                         BYE                                               "Take care now, master.

William thinks this over. "Sorry, I know little about that."

RENOVATION                                        "Spirit daemons took over down there, wrecked all the buildings they did! If    we canst clear them out, we can rebuild. It will bring many JOBS."                                                      JOBS                                              "If thou art seeking work..." He pauses for a moment, considering. "Well, don't tell Lord Baldwin, but I lost the KEY to the treasure room here!"
