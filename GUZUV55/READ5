                  THE COMBAT SWINDLER                                           Many battle-hardened adventurers are used to smashing in the heads of every     monster they come upon. Few know that there are a number of tricks that         can be employed to really fool the monsters.                                    END                                                                             One of these is the use of bloodsplats. When a monster is slain, it leaves a    bloody splotch splattered among the dungeon dirt. Search it, and you'll         likely find some rather bloody food. Bon Apetite!                               END                                                                             However, it has been observed that monsters avoid their own bloodspots! This    leads to some interesting possibilities: If an adventurer slays some nearby     whimpy critters, the blood should keep non-whimps at bay!                       END                                                                             All he need do is hide behind the spot! Another interesting technique is        digging in soft-soil areas. Apparently, the monsters are afraid of falling      into the dug-outs, and even avoid the dirtpiles!                                END                                                                             So, an adventurer can involve himself in what is known as Trench Warfare.       It involves digging seceral pits around oneself, hiding from the monsters.      FINISH
