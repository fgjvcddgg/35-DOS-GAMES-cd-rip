       HERITAGE OF ZURK II: "The Crystal Mountains"                             At the end of HOZ I, the adventurer found himself in a tearful goodbye with     Maithe in her secret room in the castle. After many adventures, he was sad      to leave her. But the magical bridge to his world was raised.                   END                                                                             It was time to go. He stepped unto the bridge. As he walked higher, he could    see the small door to his own world, just ahead. But as he approached, his      legs became like lead. In a flash of inspiration, he turned back!               END                                                                             And found himself in Maithe's arms, even as the bridge folded up behind him.    The land was happy to have him stay on awhile.                                  END                                                                             In Crystal Mountains, a long journey lie ahead with Maithe. They would          go to a distant part of the land, riding on a mythical beast called a           Xanx, and sail across the sea on a mighty vessel.                               END                                                                             Many scenes were experienced as he came to know Maithe more and more, and came  to love her ever more. In the finale, he was back in his own world, and cast    and experimental spell....                                                      END                                                                             And found Maithe cuddled beside him in his own world!
