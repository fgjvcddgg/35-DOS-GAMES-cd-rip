           LEGEND OF THE ONE-EYED GIANT                                         Rumor has it that a terrible 12 foot giant lives in the deepest dungeon in      the empire, where it is said remnants of the original lava flows can still      be seen. No one has actually seen such a creature.                              END                                                                             The technical name for it is The Cyclops. Many from topside claim to have       seen such a creature, but few are aware that the topside cyclops is actually    a smaller version of the True Cyclops. The difference is immense.               END                                                                             For this reason, no wise fighter ever dares to attack such a creature. A single hit is believed capable of draining several hundred hit points as the cyclops   simply steps on him. The cyclops fears nothing.                                 END                                                                             Therefore, the wise fighter knows when he's met his match, and knows well the   value of evasive tactics.                                                       FINISH
