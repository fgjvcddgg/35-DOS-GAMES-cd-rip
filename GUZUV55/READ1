                          JOES FOWL COOKING                                     If you want your goose cooked, or your duck, Joe the cook recommends that       you first bast it in a fine wine sauce, then throw it in the fire. Let          it set there until it sizzles, then marinate it with lots of spicy cloves.

After you           marinate it, you should re-cook it for a few more minutes, until done.
