Shareware Version 3.0 Improvements

   1) Play by E-Mail added!!!  Also, passwords are now required for any

   4) RAM requirements reduced from 520,000 bytes to 499,000 bytes.

Shareware Version 2.0 Improvements

   1) Average attributes are now 2 times better than poor attributes.
      Excellent attributes are now 3 times better than poor attributes.
      This adds more depth to the games since there is now more difference
      between the people.  For example, now there are some people who can
      move really fast or see really far and some others that move really
      slow or can hardly see at all.

   2) Agility and remaining movement points are now equal factors in
      determining combat results.  In previous versions the movement points
      remaining normally had greater weight.  The net effect of this change
      is to make agility more important.

   3) Walking visibility is now half way between running and crawling.
      Walking is now harder to see.

   4) Crawling is now a 3 movement point cost instead of 4.

   5) Becky and Dave have one better attribute in the shareware game.
