Thank you for taking the time to download and play "The Road To Baghdad" 
a freeware program that I developed as an exercise in game programming.
I would like to dedicate this program to the men and women who lost 
there lives or those that lost friends or comrades in arms while 
defending the Nation of Kuwait from the tyrant state of Iraq. This 
program would not have been possible without the assistance of 
David G. Roberts and John W. Ratcliff whos sample code and 
shareware Audio drivers make this game possible. Please feel free to 
copy this program and pass it on to others. If you discover a bug or 
would like to comment on the program please E-Mail me at  
Farpointer@AOL.COM or send me mail at:

I have another game in mind but due to the cost of development and 
the requirement that the audio drivers be registered with John W. Ratcliff
For about $1,000.00. I am willing to accept a donation that will be put 
aside for that purpose. I wish to make it perfectly clear that this version 
of the program "The Road To Baghdad version 1.0" requires no payment to be 
made as it is freeware. A donation should only be sent to support the 
development of future versions. 

Installation:
Step 1: Create a directory on your hard drive for the program.
         Example; CD\
                  MD Tank
Step 2: Copy the file you downloaded (TRTB10.EXE) to this directory

Step 3: Type TRTB10.EXE

Step 4: Type SETUP

Step 5: select Yes to auto detect message

Step 6: Select your sound card driver from list

Step 7: select Yes to test sound card

Step 8: Select driver for digital sound support

Step 9: Select Yes to test driver again

Step 10: if you could hear the sample audio select Yes again

You should be ready to run if you successfully installed the drivers. The
Program will run without sound support but it is more enjoyable with 
sound. To run the program type " Tank1 ".

Select one of the modes by typing the first letter of one of the modes
ie Keyboard is "K", Joystick is "J", Mouse is "M" and Score "S". 
Pressing the space bar will operate the program in the default mode
"K" Keyboard.
