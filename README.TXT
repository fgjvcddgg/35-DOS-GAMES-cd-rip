GENERAL INFORMATION
------------------------------------
Thank you for purchasing Aztech's Hall of Fame Games Cube. 
This compilation represents some of the very best shareware applications 
games currently available. 

Many of the applications on this CD-ROM run directly from the CD-ROM, 
although you may not be able to save games or save reconfigure options 
(you can't change the contents of a CD-ROM). Some games may need to be 
placed on your hard drive because the program needs to determine the 
configuration of your PC as it installs itself. 

Some games want to write a configuration file or a high score file to disk. 
Since it is not possible to write information to a CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read
Only Memory) any changes you make to the a game's configuration will have
to be done each time you play the game. To overcome this, you will have to
copy the game to your hard disk or to a floppy.

A NOTE ABOUT SHAREWARE
-----------------------------------------
It is important to note that the bundled price of this CD-ROM covers only 
the medium, research, assembly, production, packaging, and distribution  
costs. The actual intellectual properties (that is, the shareware programs) 
require separate payment to the author(s) if you are going to use them. 
These programs are "shareware." They are not free unless specifically 
identified as such.

Many of the games offer the first episode or level for free with the hope
that you will enjoy them enough to want to buy the additional episodes.
This is one of the best methods of shareware. Try the first level - if
you like it buy the rest.

Other games give you the full functionality and the author expects that
if you like and use their product that you will forward a recommended
payment to them. Usually there are additional incentives for "registering."

MOST COMMON SHAREWARE PROBLEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the MS-DOS world of PC's has its own share of software 
and hardware problems because of its 15-year legacy of trying to maintain 
compatibility with older versions of software and the all-important 
customer data. This has led to numerous inconsistencies and patch fixes for
making MS-DOS and PC hardware do things they were never designed to do. 

The shareware Aztech selected for this compilation is amongst the best in 
the world and some of these games approach or even exceed the quality of 
some commercial game products. Applications will freeze, hang-up, lock out, 
cause the screen to go screwy, terminate abnormally and do all the most 
horrific things that we all dislike about PC's and none of it is specific or
even necessarily caused by the application currently running. The most 
common problems you may run into are:

    Some games on this disc were written without consideration for the 
    continuing improvements in CPU performance. If the game runs too fast
    then you might consider pressing the "Turbo" or similarly-labelled button
    on your machine's front panel. It should change the display from the 
    usual 33, 66 or 100 MHz to something like 8 or 12 MHz. 

     Read the CD label which states, TO RUN: Log on to CD-ROM drive and
     type GO. Go launches a menu which allows you to run 90% of the games 
     directly from the CD.

     You did not read the HELP file (which you ARE now reading). This short 
     file has some useful information about how to use the disc and how to 
     exit from games that don't have an obvious exit.

     Not enough conventional memory usually raises the ire of many of us 
     with more than 2 MB of RAM. We know we have enough memory to play 
     most any game. You may have lots of RAM and still be getting this kind 
     of symptom or error message because the application may require more of 
     the first 640 KB of RAM in your computer than is actually available. 
     Read about loading drivers and applications in high memory and how to 
     disable Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs.

     The application is asking for information about your PC that any
     "normal" person wouldn't know but is "guessing" at, such as: 
     
     The demonic IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest) number, most often asked by 
     applications when determining the SoundBlaster sound card, usually 
     defaults to "7."  However, the assumption is that sound cards would 
     never be used at the same time someone is printing something. IRQ 7 is 
     also the number for the parallel port. Only one device may use an IRQ 
     at a time so if the user is playing music on the sound card and wants 
     to print something or another device is also using IRQ 7, an "IRQ
     conflict" arises and the system will instantly hang, usually leaving 
     the last note played also hanging on your eardrum as an irritating 
     reminder of the conflict. Changing an IRQ is not something a novice 
     should do. However, the only real alternatives are to go through all 
     the options of a particular game to find one that works or getting an
     experienced person to identify the conflict and change the IRQ setting
     on one or more of the hardware cards.

     If the IRQ number is asked for, then another number is also usually 
     asked for. This is the port address, which is the unique address of 
     the device, much like the house number on a street is unique to the 
     human device(s) residing in it. This number usually defaults to 220 
     for the SoundBlaster and this one has to be handled the same as the IRQ.

     The villainous video card is amongst the most common and most 
     misunderstood creatures of the PC. EGA was wonderful because it was a 
     standard. However, the world cannot be viewed through 16-color glasses 
     and so S/VGA was conspired as someone's master plan to reduce tech 
     support people all over the world to blithering idiots. Again, the 
     assumption is that you will know which particular VGA or S/VGA card you
     have in your PC. While the PC industry has been getting smarter about 
     automatic detection of these cards, it still remains that most 
     applications in the PC world do not support every manufacturer's 
     version of S/VGA. To compound problems, the VESA standard is not 
     strictly adhered to by even the very largest video card manufacturers. 
     You may have a manual for the card. If not, many video cards will 
     identify themselves, typically on one of the very first lines to be 
     displayed on the PC monitor during bootup. If it flashes by too quickly 
     for the user to see it, sometimes hitting the PAUSE button on the 
     keyboard will pause the bootup procedure. More often it will hang the 
     PC and the user will have to reboot. Adding to this is the question of 
     what the maximum resolution supported by the card is. Of course you 
     will always want to pick the best one because you rightly believe
     you have bought the most current technology only six months go. Of 
     course, the de facto standard changed since then. 

When it comes to a shareware compilation, each application is written by a 
different author. Not every hardware combination of video cards, CD-ROM 
drives, memory availability and sound cards can be supported by every 
application. Aztech has tried every game on this CD on at least three 
entirely different PC configurations. 

After trying some of the above, the following are some other things to 
attempt.

The first thing to try  is to copy the whole application over to the hard 
drive. Some programs want to write a high score or a configuration file or 
set up some temporary work area, which cannot be done on a read-only device. 
We also found that copying the game to the hard disk solved the problem. 

There is almost certainly some basic configuration of every game in this 
compilation that will work for most PC's.

If, after copying to the hard disk, the game is still not working
satisfactorily, the best approach to take is a step-by-step
installation of the game. The user should first configure the
game without sound, or at the most with PC speaker support. If
possible, install the game with EGA graphics and no mouse. If
the game works at this level then there is clearly some kind of
conflict in the user's machine and it is likely that the application
is not at fault.

Then, one by one, improve the capability of the game by first
installing either the video card support OR the sound support,
but not both at the same time. Once you know the culprit, it
should be much easier to resolve the problem.

At the end of the day, it may simply turn out that the game can
only be run on a particular user's machine at a configuration that
is less than the user's machine's capabilities.
