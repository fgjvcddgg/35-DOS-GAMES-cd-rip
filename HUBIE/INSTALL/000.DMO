Springs are fun. All objects, & Hubie,
will bounce indefinitely on a Spring. 
To stop an object from bouncing on
the Spring, the object will either have 
to be Pushed away from the Spring...
EndText
T
...or an object, or Hubie, must fall
onto the bouncing object.

When Hubie is bouncing, Hubie can only 
move while going up, not when falling.

Hubie will not bounce on the Spring
because Hubie did not fall onto it.  In
order to start bouncing, Hubie will
have to Crush down on the Spring.
