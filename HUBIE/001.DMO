This is a tricky board. The object is
to navigate Hubie to the Exit Door. The
Cracked Bricks next to the Exit Door
must be Crushed.  But, how do you get
Hubie to the Cracked Bricks?
EndText
T
Let's study the board.  There are
2 Boulders, a Plunger and TNT, some
Green Vines, 3 Wooden Logs, Icy
Bricks, some Pipes, Fire, 3 Metal
Cubes, a Magnet, and a Spring.

Remember, everything outlined in
black can either be moved or rotated

Notice that Hubie can stand on the 
Plunger and not detonate the TNT.
Hubie must Crush down or fall on the 
Plunger to detonate the TNT.

Ow.  Hubie cannot move or Crush the
Green Vines.  Hubie cannot Climb this
Vine because the TNT is resting on
top of it.  So, Hubie will have to move
the TNT.  Let's put it by the Exit....

Did you see how the TNT slid along
the Icy Bricks?  All objects, including
Hubie, will slide uncontrollably along 
the top of the Icy Bricks....

Hubie is now going to explode the TNT.
Notice the objects around the TNT:
a Wooden Log, a Boulder, a Metal Cube,
and a set of Bricks.  What do you think
will happen?

Hubie is stuck.  The force of the
Magnet pulling the Metal Cube does
not allow Hubie to Push the Metal
Cube away. So, Hubie will have to
go up.
