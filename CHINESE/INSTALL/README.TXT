                     ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS


QUESTION:  How do I install Chinese Checkers to my hard drive?

ANSWER:    Chinese Checkers comes with a simple installation utility.
             1.  Insert the diskette into the floppy drive you want to
                 install from.
             2.  At the DOS prompt type A:INSTALL (or B:INSTALL)  then
                 press [Enter].
             3.  Follow  the  instructions  as  they  appear  on  your
                 screen.


QUESTION:  How do I run Chinese Checkers under Microsoft Windows?

           our installation utility will install it for you:
           1.  In  the Program Manager press the ALT-F for the  "Files
               Menu".
           2.  Press R for "Run".
           3.  Enter A:INSTALL (or B:INSTALL)
           4.  Follow the directions as they appear on your screen.


QUESTION:  My mouse works in Microsoft Windows, why doesn't it work in
           Chinese Checkers?

ANSWER:    Windows has special built-in drivers to support  mice.  Our
           software  looks  for a Microsoft  compatible  mouse  driver
           which is loaded when you  turn on your computer. A diskette
           should have  come with your mouse which contains MOUSE.SYS,
           MOUSE.COM  or  similar  files.  Try  placing  the   command
           MOUSE.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file or the  command MOUSE.COM
           in  your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.   These are the files that  DOS
           executes when you  turn on your computer, and if your mouse
           is  Microsoft compatible, your mouse should now work.


QUESTION:  I get the message "VGA Monitor required." when I try to run
           Chinese Checkers.  What I do?

ANSWER:    Your IBM compatible PC doesn't have a VGA monitor.  If  you
           want  to  run Chinese Checkers, you will have to  go  to  a
           computer  store  to see it run.  Maybe you'll  decide  that
           it's time to get a new computer!

           Some  VGA monitors fail our VGA monitor test.  If you  know
           that  you  have  a VGA monitor try  running  this  command:
           CHINESE /M.


QUESTION:  Can I run Chinese Checkers from a floppy drive?

ANSWER:    Yes, by entering the command CHINESE, but if you have  less
           than  1 megabyte of memory, the game will run  MUCH  slower
           than  it  would  on a hard drive.  On  most  386  computers
           Chinese Checkers runs just fine from a floppy disk.

QUESTION:  I  get the message "Not Enough Conventional memory" and  my
           program  doesn't  run.  Running the  program  from  Windows
           gives  me  a message which says "Decrease the  .PIF  memory
           requirement."  What can I do?

ANSWER:    DOS  6.0  and DOS 6.2 provides a  utility  called  MEMMAKER
           which is designed to free up as much conventional memory as
           possible.  If you have DOS 5.0 run the MEM /C command  from
           the  DOS  prompt.  If your computer has less  than   550000
           bytes free conventional memory, CONFIG.SYS or  AUTOEXEC.BAT
           is loading up a memory resident program which is taking  up
           memory.  Locate a knowledgeable person and ask  him/her  to
           help  you  load these programs into upper  memory  instead.
           See  the information in the file MEMORY.TXT for a  detailed
           explanation.


QUESTION:  I  don't understand what "shareware" is.  Why do I have  to
           order Chinese Checkers if I already have a copy of it?

ANSWER:    Because  you haven't paid for it.  If you "bought"  Chinese
           Checkers  from  a shareware vendor, you only paid  for  the
           disk,  not  the actual program.  At the opening  screen  of
           Chinese Checkers press the F1 key.  A detailed  explanation
           about the shareware concept will appear for you there.

           To  reward those who actually register Chinese Checkers  we
           have  included extra "bonus" features which are not in  the
           shareware version.  See the order form for details.


QUESTION:  What is the name of the cute Chinese character who acts  as
           "host" for Chinese Checkers?

ANSWER:    Wai Fu Kan.  We don't actually know who named him that, but
           one  day we mysteriously started getting "junk" mail  under
           that name.  After checking with an authority on the Chinese
           language, the name stuck.
