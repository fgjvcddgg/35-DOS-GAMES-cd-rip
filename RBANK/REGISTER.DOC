  Note: registering a shareware-authorized toy obtained from a BBS or a
        shareware dealer is the same as purchasing the toy direct from us
        as non-shareware (retail).  Use this form for either, you will be
        sent the latest version of the toys you are registering either way.

     $5.00 per toy (3rd toy and up). <E.G., you can register 8 toys for
     2 x $6.00 + 6 x $5.00 = $42.00.>  The $49.95 special price is only for
     a Toy Pak of 15 pre-designated sequential toys (1-15, 16-30, 31-45, see

     non-shareware-authorized paks and doodads too!  You can deduct any
