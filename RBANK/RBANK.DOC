INSTRUCTIONS:

THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTS THE GAME OF RUSSIAN BANK, A.K.A. CRAPETTE OR ROBUSE.
THIS IS A 2-PLAYER DUELING SOLITAIRE CARD GAME.  YOU CAN PLAY ANOTHER PLAYER
OR PLAY THE COMPUTER.  THE COMPUTER CAN ALSO PLAY BOTH HANDS WHILE YOU WATCH
FOR A DEMO.

PLAYERS:
THERE ARE 2 PLAYERS.  PLAYER 1'S CARDS ARE SHOWN AT THE BOTTOM, PLAYER 2'S
AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.  THE DEFAULT IS FOR THE COMPUTER TO PLAY FOR PLAYER
2 (TOP), THE KEYBOARD TO PLAY FOR PLAYER 1 (BOTTOM).

THE DECK:
EACH PLAYER STARTS WITH A FULL 52-CARD PACK.

THE SHUFFLE:
THE COMPUTER SHUFFLES BOTH DECKS BEFORE THE START OF PLAY.

INITAL TABLEAU:
AFTER SHUFFLING, EACH PLAYER LAYS HIS DECK (HAND) FACE DOWN ON HIS LEFT SIDE,
THEN DEALS HIMSELF A PILE OF 13 CARDS FACE DOWN AND TO HIS RIGHT, AND TURNS
THE TOP CARD FACE UP.  THIS RIGHT-HAND PILE WILL BE CALLED THE STOCK OR THE
RESERVE.

NEXT, EACH PLAYER DEALS 4 CARDS FACE UP IN A COLUMN ABOVE THE RESERVE, WITH NO
OVERLAPPING, TO FOUND HIS SIDE OF THE "HOUSE".

THE DOUBLE DEAL CAUSES A SYMMETRICAL LAYOUT ON THE TABLE.

THERE MUST BE SUFFICIENT WIDTH LEFT BETWEEN THE PLAYERS' ROWS OF CARDS TO HOLD
2 MORE ROWS OF FOUNDATION CARDS TO BE BUILT UP LATER.  THIS IS AUTOMATIC IN
THIS PROGRAM.

HOUSES:
EACH PLAYER'S 4 FACE-UP CARDS ARE CALLED HOUSES, AND THE COLUMNS AS A WHOLE
ARE CALLED TABLEAU AND ARE THE TWO PLAYERS' COMMON PROPERTY; THEY ARE BUILT UP
DURING PLAY.  WHEN EMPTY A HOUSE MAY BE RE-FOUNDED ONLY ACCORDING TO THE RULES
OF PLAY BELOW.

OBJECT OF PLAY:
TO BE THE FIRST PLAYER TO CLEAR OUT ALL THE CARDS FROM ONE'S HAND AND RESERVE.

FOUNDATIONS OR CENTER:
AS EACH OF THE 8 ACES BECOME AVAILABLE DURING PLAY THEY ARE PLACED IN THE
SPACE BETWEEN THE 2 ROWS OF HOUSES TO FORM THE FOUNDATION OR CENTER PILES. EACH
FOUNDATION PILE IS BUILT UP IN SUIT AND SEQUENCE TO THE KING: A23456789TJQK.
CARDS FROM THE 2 DECKS MAY BE BUILT ONTO THE SAME FOUNDATION PILE.

SPECIFYING CARD POSITIONS FROM THE KEYBOARD:
TYPE "R" FOR RESERVE; "1" FOR HOUSE CARD 1; "2", "3", "4", ... , "8" FOR OTHER
HOUSE CARDS; "F" FOR FOUNDATION (COMPUTER FIGURES OUT PROPER PILE TO PUT CARD
ON).  OR, USE THE MOUSE TO CLICK THE CARD POSITION.

ON THE SCREEN, THE HOUSES ARE LABELLED WITH A "H", EACH PLAYER'S DECK (HAND)
IS LABELLED WITH A "D", EACH RESERVE IS LABELLED WITH A "R", AND EACH WASTEPILE
IS LABELLED WITH A "W".

OPENING PLAY:
THE PLAYER WITH THE LOWEST-RANKING TOP RESERVE CARD BEGINS PLAY; IF RESERVE
CARDS ARE EQUAL THEN THE PLAYER WITH THE LOWEST-RANKING HOUSE CARD GOES FIRST;
IF THEY TOO ARE EQUAL THE COMPUTER FLIPS A COIN TO CHOOSE THE STARTER.

EACH PLAYER MUST, IF ABLE, TRANSFER TO THE FOUNDATION AREA ANY ACE TURNED UP
AND VISIBLE.  WHENEVER HE PLAYS THE TOP CARD OF THE RESERVE HE TURNS UP THE NEXT
CARD IN THE RESERVE.  HAVING DONE SO IF POSSIBLE, HE NEXT TURNS UP THE TOP CARD
OF HIS HAND AND MAKES ANY MORE MOVES THAT MAY THEN BE POSSIBLE.

FROM THERE ON THE FOLLOWING GENERAL RULES APPLY:

A. PLAY.  AT EACH TURN A PLAYER MAY MAKE AS MANY MOVES AS HE CAN AND WISHES,
BUT MUST STOP WHEN HE HAS NO LEGAL CONTINUATION OR WHEN HIS OPPONENT STOPS HIM
FOR HAVING MADE AN ERROR IN PLAY.  WHENEVER HE CAN TRANSFER AN AVAILABLE CARD
TO A FOUNDATION PILE, OR HIS RESERVE CARD TO A HOUSE, HE MUST DO SO IMMEDIATELY.

THEREAFTER HE TURNS UP CARDS FROM HIS HAND ONE BY ONE, PAUSING TO PLAY EACH TO
THE TABLE IF POSSIBLE AND MAKE ANY SUBSEQUENT PLAYS BEFORE TURNING UP THE NEXT.
AS SOON AS HE TURNS FROM HIS HAND A CARD WHICH IS UNPLAYABLE HE LAYS IT FACE-UP
ON THE TABLE TO FORM A WASTE PILE, ENDING HIS TURN -- EVEN IF HE SEES A MOVE
HE COULD HAVE MADE.

B. MOVES.  TRANSFERRING AN AVAILABLE CARD LEGALLY FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
IS CALLED A MOVE.  AN AVAILABLE CARD IS EITHER FROM THE HAND, THE RESERVE, OR
A HOUSE.  IT MAY BE MOVED TO:

1. A FOUNDATION IF IT IS IN SUIT AND ASCENDING SEQUENCE.  MOVING A CARD TO A
   FOUNDATION IS MANDATORY IF POSSIBLE.
  
2. A HOUSE IF IT IS IN ALTERNATE COLOR AND DESCENDING SEQUENCE, E.G., BLACK
   JACK ON RED QUEEN.  NOTHING MAY BE BUILT ON AN ACE, SINCE IT MUST IMMEDIATELY
   BE TRANSFERRED TO A FOUNDATION.  AN EMPTY HOUSE MAY BE FILLED WITH ANY
   AVAILABLE CARD.

3. THE OPPONENT'S RESERVE OR WASTE PILE, FACE-UP, IF IT IS OF THE SAME SUIT
   AND CONSECUTIVE (ASCENDING OR DESCENDING) RANK.

C. ORDER AND STOPPING.
CERTAIN MOVES MUST BE MADE IN A CERTAIN ORDER, AND IF A PLAYER VIOLATES THIS
RULE THE OPPONENT MAY INTERVENE, MAKE HIM TAKE THE MOVE BACK, FORCE HIM TO
MAKE THE MANDATORY MOVES, AND STOP HIM FROM PLAYING FURTHER.  THE RULES ARE:

1. A CARD THAT CAN BE PLAYED TO A FOUNDATION MUST BE DONE SO AT ONCE.
  
2. IF THERE IS A CHOICE OF CARDS THAT CAN BE PLAYED TO A FOUNDATION,
   PRIORITY MUST GO TO THE RESERVE CARD.

3. AN EMPTY HOUSE MUST BE FILLED FROM THE RESERVE BEFORE A CARD IS TURNED
   FROM THE HAND.  ONLY IF THE RESERVE IS EMPTY CAN THE CARD BE TURNED FROM
   THE HAND.
  
IN TOMMY'S RUSSIAN BANK, THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS FOR WRONG MOVES
AND PREVENTS THEM.

MAKING MOVES FROM THE KEYBOARD OR MOUSE:
IF YOU HAVE A MOUSE, JUST POINT AT THE 'FROM' CARD, CLICK IT, THEN POINT TO
THE 'TO' CARD POSITION, AND CLICK IT.  TO DRAW FROM DECK, JUST CLICK IT.
TO DISCARD DECK CARD TO WASTEPILE, JUST CLICK WASTEPILE.

IF USING THE KEYBOARD, HIT "." TO TURN UP CARD FROM HAND.  IF CURRENT TURN-UP
IS UNPLAYED, HITTING "." WILL MOVE TURN-UP TO WASTE PILE AND END TURN; "P" CAN
ALSO BE HIT.  HITTING "X" LETS YOU ABORT THE CURRENT GAME ENTIRELY AND START A
NEW ONE.  AN ONSCREEN LEGEND DISPLAYS THE ABBREVIATIONS FOR THE VARIOUS CARD
POSITIONS: R FOR RESERVE, W FOR WASTEPILE, 1..8 FOR HOUSE CARD POSITIONS 1..8,
D FOR DECK, F FOR FOUNDATION.  SO, TO MOVE DECK TO OPPONENT'S RESERVE, TYPE
"DR"; TO MOVE YOUR TOP RESERVE CARD TO HOUSE #3, HIT "R3"; TO MOVE HOUSE CARD
NUMBER 7 TO THE FOUNDATION, HIT "7F".

FORCE COMPUTER PLAYER TO END TURN:
SOMETIMES THE COMPUTER MIGHT APPEAR TO BE GETTING IN AN ENDLESS LOOP WHEN
MAKING MOVES ON THE TABLEAU.  YOU CAN FORCE IT TO END ITS TURN BY HITTING THE
ESC KEY.

GAME.
WHEN A PLAYER HAS PLAYED HIS LAST CARD HE TURNS HIS WASTE PILE DOWN TO FORM
A NEW HAND.  WHEN HE HAS PLAYED OUT ALL THE CARDS FROM THE HAND, RESERVE, AND
WASTE PILES, HE WINS AND THE GAME IS OVER.

SCORING.
WINNER SCORES 30 POINTS FOR GAME, PLUS 1 POINT FOR EACH CARD LEFT IN THE
OPPONENT'S HAND AND WASTE PILES, PLUS 2 POINTS FOR EACH CARD LEFT IN THE
OPPONENT'S RESERVE.

RUNNING SCORE DISPLAY:
DURING GAME PLAY, THE SCORE EACH PLAYER WOULD GET IF HE WON NOW IS DISPLAYED
IN THE BLANK CARD DISPLAYS OF THE TABLEAU; UNDERNEATH IN PARENTHESES IS THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF HAND PLUS RESERVE PLUS WASTE CARDS.

MATCH.
MATCH SCORE CAN BE SET ANYWHERE FROM 30 TO 999 POINTS.  FIRST PLAYER TO
REACH MATCH SCORE WINS THE MATCH.  THE COMPUTER SAVES THE GAME AND MATCH
SCORES ON DISK ON THE FILE RBANK.SCR.  IF YOU WANT TO CLEAR THE MATCH SCORE
AND START OVER, JUST ERASE THIS FILE.
