THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF CYBERBOX v4.30
A VGA logic strategy game! The object is
to escape from each of 15 rooms, as
efficiently as you can, by pushing and
pulling boxes around. Plenty of options
and features! You can change your screen
colors, animation speed, cursor image and
much more! Note that quick reflexes are
not required here. Only your
resourcefulness! Additional room-volumes
are available. Very addicting game
