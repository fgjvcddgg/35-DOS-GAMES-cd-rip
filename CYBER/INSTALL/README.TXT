     Operation Vulture 3:  Cyber Chopper
     README.TXT
     -----------------------------------------
     
     All important documentation dealing with the actual use
of Cyber  Chopper  is  contained  within  the  game  itself.
Simply choose "Information" from the Main Menu.
     
     NOTE:   All menu  selections are  made with  player 1's
control device,  which is  by default  the keyboard.  So, to
use the  menus, you  must use  the arrow  keys and  the fire
(CTRL) key.   If  you change player 1's key assignments, you
must use  the new keys.  Similarly, if player 1's control is
changed to  joystick or  mouse, that  device must be used in
the menus.
     
     You may  be wondering  why this game is 3rd in a series
when you've probably never seen versions 1 and 2.  Operation
Vulture 1  and 2  were made  in April, 1992, based on a good
concept, but  a bad  programming language,  as well as a bad
programming style.    Once  we  figured  out  what  we  were
supposed to  be doing  the whole  time, we  decided to  give
another try  to Operation  Vulture, and Cyber Chopper is the
result.
     Please don't ask for Operation Vulture 1 or 2, as we're
not especially  proud  of  them.    Their  quality  is  zero
compared to  Cyber Chopper,  and they  represent a past we'd
really rather  forget.   Thank you, and remember to look for
us in the future.
