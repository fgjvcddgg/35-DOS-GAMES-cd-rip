Limited Distribution License:

As the exclusive North American distributor for the registered version of
Flying Tigers, HomeBrew Software authorizes distribution of the shareware

ASP Approved Vendors in good standing are hereby given permission to
distribute Flying Tigers package.  Non-ASP member vendors must request
permission prior to distributing this package.

                - Flying Tigers, Version 1.20 - Vendor.DOC -


The Flying Tigers is defined as containing all the material listed
in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is not
complete and distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a
complete package suitable for distribution.

The Flying Tigers package - including all related program files and
documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed
as a complete package, without exception.  The PACKING.LST text file
contains a list of all files that are part of the Flying Tigers package.

   Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or installation
   batch files used by many shareware disk vendors, are acceptable.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the Flying Tigers
package.  A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette,
shipping and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed
US$8.00 in the U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00 internationally.

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Flying Tigers package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive
package.  Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging
offer, without a written agreement from HomeBrew Software.

   ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the Flying Tigers package
   as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM
   package) may do so provided that all the other restrictions are met.

   Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the
   Flying Tigers package as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk
   set, or a CD-ROM package) must obtain permission from HomeBrew Software
   prior to beginning such a distribution.

   If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection,
   please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version
   is over twelve (12) months old then please contact us to ensure that you
   have the most current version.  This version was released in November,
   1994.

Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you would like to distribute the Flying Tigers package as a Disk-of-
the-Month, or as part of a subscription or monthly service, then the
following restrictions apply:

   ASP Associate (Disk Vendor) Members in good standing are hereby given
   permission to distribute the Flying Tigers package under the Disk-of-
   the-Month style of distribution.

   Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that you
   have the most current version of the software.

   You cannot use a Disk-of-the-Month distribution to use up your inventory
   of old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as
   Disk-of-the-Month disks.

The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or in part, using
any means, without the written permission of HomeBrew Software.  In other
words, the disk-based documentation may not be distributed in PRINTED
(hardcopy) form.

The Flying Tigers package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or other
literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".  Shareware is
"Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free.

HomeBrew Software prohibits the distribution of outdated versions of the
Flying Tigers package, without written permission from HomeBrew Software.
If the version you have is over twelve (12) months old, please contact us
to ensure that you have the most current version.  This version was
released in November, 1994.

Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile,
disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed program
except as provided in this agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall
result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.

Vendor Update Program:
----------------------

Most non-ASP vendors have standard procedures for acquiring new files.
They get them from other vendors, BBSs, etc.  Most authors cannot afford to
mail disks to hundreds (perhaps thousands) of vendors.  However, some
vendors prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you would
like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically, then please help
us to cover the cost.

If you are NOT an ASP Approved Vendor (in good standing), but you would
still like to receive automatic updates directly from us, then please take
advantage of our Vendor Update Program.  Under this program you can receive
updates for an entire year for only $10 per program (this helps to offset
our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with your name, company name,
mailing address, the name of the person we should contact (such as your
disk librarian), the program (or programs) for which you would like to
receive updates, and a check or money order for $10 for each program
(Countries outside of North America please add an additional $10 per
program).  Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank only please.

The Vendor Update Program is available for the following products (as of
November, 1994):

   3D CyberBlaster
   Bars
   BrainStorm
   Dschump!
   FinTris
   Flying Tigers
   GateWorld: The Seed Ship
   Puzzle
   Shards
   Star Hammer
   SuperHer for Windows
   World Quest

All vendors participating in our Vendor Update Program will automatically
receive any NEW programs which we may release while their Vendor Update
Program is in effect.

NOTE: ASP Associate Members automatically receive free updates and do not
      need to apply for the Vendor Update Program.  This is yet another
      advantage to being an ASP Associate Member.

The Vendor Update Program is only intended to help us cover our expenses in
those cases where a vendor desires to obtain the program directly from us.
If you have other standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our Vendor Update Program.
