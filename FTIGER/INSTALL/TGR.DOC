			       Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Flying Tigers is designed to be a fast pace shoot-em game with
multiple weapons, power ups, enemies and bosses. The object is simple:
survive and see how far you can get, while racking up a few points in
the process. But, seriously your objective is to destroy the bosses who
are attempting to take over the world, this won't be easy each boss has
it own way of attack!
    In scenario 1(sharware version) you will be thrown into the middle
of 1942, the techno bosses are starting transfering technology to the
Japanese Empire. It is your job to stop these bosses at all cost!
    In scenario 2 and 3(registered version) you will be in 1972 and 2012
fighting the techno bosses.  Beware, these bosses are not like the first,
they are much smarter and tougher.

		    What is needed to run Flying Tigers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   * 386 minimum, 486 and above recomended
   * at least 4 Meg of memory, 3 Meg may work without sound
   * fast video card, some video cards really slow things down
   * sound card recomended
   * joystick, Gravis pad recommended



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			     Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   To get started running Flying Tigers type: TGR, this is the main program.
If it is your first time running the program it will ask you information
about which language you would like to use, I assume you would press 'E' for
English since your reading this. It will then ask if you want to auto-detect
for sound. After all this you will see the sound settings and language. If
everything is ok, hit 'y' to start the game.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       Control
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The default keys for Flying Tigers are as follows:

   Arrow keys for player 1 -- move plane
   <enter> ------------------ fire weapon 1
   <"> ---------------------- fire weapon 2
   A,W,X,D for player 2 ----- move plane
   F ------------------------ fire weapon 1
   G ------------------------ fire weapon 2

   *These keys can be re defined within the game.

   It is recommended that players use joysticks or game pads, this greatly
increases playability.

   There are several commands that a user can use during game
play in order to enhance game play.

   TAB ------- pause game
   ESC ------- game playing option menu
   F1 -------- slow down game
   F2 -------- speed up game
   F5 -------- decrease music volume (includes digital drums)
   F6 -------- increase music volume (includes digital drums)
   F7 -------- decrease digital drum volume
   F8 -------- increase digital drum volume
   F9 -------- decrease sound effects volume    
   F10 ------- increase sound effects volume

				Sound
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The first thing to do is run the setup program to determine what type
of sound system you have, or you can run the program and let the program
auto-detect your system.

   During auto-detect Flying Tigers will scan first for environmental
variables for the setting "BLASTER= A220 I5 D1 T4". These settings will be
used first before a autodetect.
   What do these settings mean?
      - A220 Sound Blaster card is at the address 220h
      - I5   Sound Blaster is using interrupt 5
      - D1   Sound Blaster is using DMA channel 1
      - T4   Sound Blaster is of type 4, there are several
	     different types you can put here, however Flying
	     Tigers recognizes only three. These are T2,T3 this
	     will be Sound Blaster 8 bit mono, T4 Sound Blaster
	     8 Stereo, T5 Sound Blaster micro channel and T6
	     Sound Blaster 16/AWE 32.

   It is always a good idea to use the setup program to configure your
sound card, unless you are running the program directly from CD-ROM.

   For those with Gravis cards you will need to run the batch file
called "gravis.bat" this will load a general midi patch into the sound
card so the music will map to the right sounds. We added Gravis support
late in devlopement, because of this there might be a slight delay of
sounds on some Gravis cards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		 Hints for faster game play (if needed)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Flying Tigers was designed to run as fast as possible on the PC's.
However, the speed of the game is ultimately decided by what type of
video card and how fast memory is copied to the card. The methods used
might also cause some type of snow effect on some cards.

    Try playing a harder skill level, planes and your ship move faster
the harder the skill level.

    Using a joystick or game pad also slows things down a bit, try using
keyboard if extra speed is needed.

    Sounds take up a good deal of time to process, it would be a good
idea to delete the setup.cfg file and when starting the game answer no
to auto-detection. This will disable sounds completly.

    There are some game arguments for speed optimizations, they
are: TGR [1,2,3]. Optimazation 1 reduces the number of sprites drawn,
optimization 2 reduces smoothing checking and optimazation 3 turns off
sounds. Try these as a last resort, they can greatly detract from the games
apperence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		    Some problems we have encountered
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Flying Tigers was not designed to run under windows, so don't try it.
It shouldn't work.

    Flying Tigers has conflicts with QEMM, and older version of Novell EMS
these conflicts are mainly because of sounds, either remove the sounds from
Flying Tigers or run Flying Tigers directly from DOS.
