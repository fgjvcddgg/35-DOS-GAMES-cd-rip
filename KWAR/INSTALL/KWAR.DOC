  Description:
  War In Korea is a 2 player war game played on a map of the Korean peninsula.
  Each player has an army consisting of 80 divisions: 40 Infantry,
  20 Armored, 10 Air Cavalry & 10 Marine. Players alternate turns,
  moving all their units then resolving battles at the end of each turn.
  A player wins by eliminating all enemy units or capturing all enemy cities
  and holding them for 1 turn.

  The  Map:
  The map shows the countries of North & South Korea, part of China and a
  a small portion of Japan. The map has a grid divided into horizontal &
  vertical coordinates numbered horizontally(east/west) 1 to 160 and
  vertically(north/south) 0 to 115, for a total of 18,560 squares.

     Terrain:
     Each square is colored or marked according to its terrain.

     land-green
     cities-gray
     mountains-black inverted V 's on white
     ocean-blue
     roads-red lines
     rivers-blue lines
     bridges-red lines over rivers

  Units:
  NKPA (North Korean Peoples Army) & PRC (Peoples Republic of China) units
  are colored light-magenta (referred to as red units).
  ROK (Republic Of Korea [south]) & U.S./Allied units are colored light-cyan
  (referred to as blue units).

  In map modes of 4, 8, & 12 to 1:
  Infantry units are marked with an 'X' inside a white box.
  Armored units are marked with a yellow rectangle bordered by white.
  Air Cavalry units are marked with an 'X'ed blue circle bordered by white.
  Marine units are marked with an 'M'in a red rectangle bordered by white.

  In 2 to 1 map mode:
  Infantry units are marked with an 'X'.
  Armored units are marked with a yellow square.
  Air-Cav units are marked with a blue square.
  Marine units are marked with a red square.

  In the full map (1 to 1) mode only the colors of the units(red/blue)
  are shown. In maps of 8 to 1 and 12 to 1, the unit number is shown
  on the unit & in map of 12 to 1, the unit types (INF,ARM,AIR,MRN)
  are also shown.

  There are 2 types of specialized infantry units:
     Marine-can land on beach squares ( any open-land square adjacent to an
     ocean square).
     Air Cavalry-can fly to and land on any open-land square.

  Movement:
  At the start of each turn each unit is given a movement count (mc).
  INF,AIR,MRN units get 24 mc. ARM units get 36 mc.
  As the unit is moved the mc is decreased depending on the terrain.

     travel on roads, cities & bridges costs 1 mc.
     travel on land costs 3 mc.
     travel in mountains costs 4 mc.
     crossing rivers (not on bridges) costs 3 mc.

  Some movement is prohibited:
     armor units in mountains
     in a square occupied by another unit
     when mc=0 or not enough mc's to cross certain terrain

  Don't worry too much about all the rules, the computer will let you know
  if you try to break any of them!

  All actions in this game are controlled by the movement of the mouse and
  the 2 mouse buttons. The ONLY time the keyboard is used is to enter the
  file name of a saved game.

  LETS PLAY!

  Start the game by loading the game diskette and typing kwar at the
  DOS prompt. The message "PLEASE WAIT-LOADING DATA FILES" will appear for
  a moment followed by the game map and a sign-on message.

  SIGN-ON MESSAGE:
  Gives the name of the game, version number, instructions for
  ordering a registered copy and 2 buttons. The 'PRINT ORDER' button
  is used to print an order form on your printer. If you have no printer
  or it is off or off-line, a 'CHECK PRINTER !' message will be displayed
  when you push the button. The 'OK' button is used to erase the sign-on
  messages. To push a button, move the mouse arrow over the button and
  push the left mouse button.

  SELECT GAME WINDOW:

  If there are any saved games on the disk, a black window will be shown over
  part of the map. This window allows you to select a new game or a saved game
  (all saved games have a .SAV extension ie: EXAMPLE.SAV).
  If there are NO saved games this window will not appear and you will start
  a new game. To select between new game and saved games move the mouse up
  or down, the highlight window will move as you move the mouse. When the
  desired selection is highlighted, push LEFT or RIGHT mouse button.

  For now select NEW GAME.

  You are now ready to start the game!

  STARTING TO PLAY:

  Look at the screen. You have the game map with the units (RED & BLUE) in
  their bivouac ares, a mouse arrow somewhere in the middle of the map,
  7 rectangle "buttons" on the left side and a grid location displayed in
  the top right corner.

  A Note on the buttons:
  Buttons colored light gray are inactive, buttons lit up in another color
  are active.

  Move the MOUSE:

  The arrow will move around the map and the grid location will change.
  The sign-on messages will disappear when the mouse is moved.

  The MAP button:

  The light green button on the left is the MAP button. This allows you
  to zoom a part of the map to 2,4,8 or 12 times its size. At the start of the
  game the button reads "MAP 1 TO 1".

  Using the MAP button:

  Move the mouse arrow over the MAP button and push the LEFT mouse button.
  You hear a beep, the button flashes and now reads "MAP 2 TO 1" but the map
  didn't change. HOW COME?? That brings us to...

  Zooming the map:

  With the MAP button reading "2 to 1" move the arrow to anywhere on the map.
  Push the LEFT mouse button. A white outline will appear on the map about
  half the size of the map as long as the button is held down.
  This shows the area of the map you will zoom to when you push the RIGHT
  mouse button.Now release the LEFT button and push the RIGHT mouse button.
  The area of the map shown will be the area that was inside the outline.
  Now move the arrow back to the MAP button and push the LEFT mouse
  button. The button flashes and reads "4 to 1". Move the arrow to anywhere
  on the map and push the RIGHT mouse button. The map doubles again.
  Try this for the "8 to 1" and "12 to 1" map zooms.
  You can move around the map in the 2,4,8 & 12 to 1 modes by moving the arrow
  to the square you desire to and pushing the RIGHT mouse button. That square
  will now be in the center of the screen. But what about getting back to the
  big picture?	Just point on the MAP button again and push (& release) the
  LEFT mouse button until the MAP button reads "1 to 1". Now push the RIGHT
  mouse button. The whole map appears. As long as the whole map is shown,
  you can change the zoom on the MAP button (2 to 1, 4 to 1, 8 to 1, 12 to 1),
  move the mouse arrow to anywhere on the map, and use the LEFT mouse button
  to outline the area of the map that will be shown when you push the RIGHT
  mouse button.

  Get familiar with zooming the map then we'll learn....

  MOVING A UNIT: [picking up, moving & dropping]

  NOTE: You can not pick up and move units when full map is shown (1 to 1).
  Put the arrow on a BLUE unit and push the LEFT mouse button. You hear a beep
  and the unit name and "MOVES LEFT=" appear in the bottom right. You have just
  "picked that unit up". Now move the mouse. The unit follows the arrow. You
  will notice that the unit does not move until the arrow is near the center
  of the next square. this is to make it easier to move the unit without
  mistakenly moving to the wrong square. If you try to make an illegal move
  (such as moving a unit on top of another), you will hear a buzz and a red on
  yellow error message will appear in the bottom left of the screen. Notice that
  the "MOVES LEFT" number will decrease as you move. When you are out of moves
  and try to move the unit, the error message will say "INSUFFICIENT MOVES
  LEFT". OK you say, I've got this unit stuck to my arrow and I'm out of moves.
  Now what do I do?...Easy! Just push the LEFT mouse button again. You will
  hear 2 beeps and the unit name and MOVES LEFT will disappear from the bottom
  right. You have now "dropped the unit" and are free to move the arrow to
  another unit and continue moving units.

  OOPS!! What if I moved the unit to the wrong square or changed my mind ?
	 That brings us to......

  The CANCEL button:

  If you mistakenly move the unit to the wrong square, "drop" the unit and
  move the arrow over the CANCEL MOVE button. Push the LEFT mouse button.
  You will hear a beep, the button will flash, and the arrow will move over
  the unit you dropped. Notice that the unit is located where it was before
  you made the move. The units mc (movement count) was also restored to
  its previous value. That brings us to another button on the screen....

  The MOVES DONE button:

  Move the arrow over the MOVES DONE button and push the LEFT mouse button.
  You will hear a beep and the button color will change from blue to red (to
  be technical, from light cyan to light magenta).
  Now it is RED's turn to move . You (or your opponent) can move all the red
  units. You can end the turn at any time, you do not have to move all your
  units. You can move as many or as few as you like. At each new turn, the
  units are restored with their full movement counts (mc's).
  Push the MOVES DONE button again and it turns blue (Its now BLUE's turn
  again). There is one more type of movement we have not covered, that is...



  AIR & SEA MOVEMENT:

  All units except AIR can be moved by sea from one friendly port to
  another friendly port. This can be done only if the unit is in a friendly
  port at the start of a turn. A friendly port is defined as a city square
  adjacent to an ocean square in a city controlled by your army. This type of
  movement does not deduct any mc's (movement counts) from the unit.

								     Page 4


  AIR units can move by air from any land square to any land square not in
  an enemy's zone of control (ie: not adjacent to an enemy unit).
  No mc's are deducted.

  MRN (marine) units can move from any friendly port to another friendly port
  or to any beach square (a land square adjacent to an ocean square).
  Unlike other units MRN units can land on a beach square adjacent to an enemy
  unit ( as long as they attack that unit at the end of the turn).

  NOTE: Air and sea movement can only be done once per unit per turn.
	and may not have made any other moves that turn.

  HOW TO DO AIR/SEA MOVEMENT:

  SEA: Pick up a unit with the LEFT mouse button (remember: unit must be in
  a friendly port city square at the start of turn). Now push the RIGHT mouse
  button. A message will appear at the bottom left "SEA TRANSFER-MOVE POINTER
  TO DESTINATION AND DROP UNIT". Note: if the unit was not in a port square
  or did not have its full mc, ie: it had been moved in this turn, a red on
  yellow error message will appear in the bottom left.
  Using the mouse, move the arrow to another friendly port square. The unit
  will follow the arrow (sometimes it lags behind but it will always catch up).
  Using the LEFT mouse button drop the unit in the new port square. Note:
  You may notice when you are dragging the unit over other units they will
  disappear. Don't worry, they will be replaced when you drop the unit.
  If you try to drop the unit anywhere but a friendly port, you will hear
  a buzz and an error message at the bottom left will remind you of the rule.
  Remember MRN units can also land on beaches.

  AIR: Just like sea movement except you pick up an AIR CAV unit in a land
  square at the start of a turn and move it to any open land square not
  adjacent to an enemy unit. Like sea movement, air movement costs no mc's.


  FRIENDLY & UNFRIENDLY CITIES:

  To find the status of a city, move the mouse arrow over an open city square
  ie: no units underneath it, and push and hold the LEFT mouse button. A
  message will appear at the bottom right telling you the name of the city.
  The background color of the message will tell you the status of the city:
  light cyan-BLUE control
  light magenta-RED control
  half light cyan & half light magenta-CONTESTED
  The message will disappear when you let up on the LEFT mouse button.

  HOW TO CONTROL A CITY:
  At the start of the game all the cities in South Korea are under BLUE
  control and all the cities in North Korea are under RED control. To gain
  control of an enemy held city, enter or pass through that city (if no enemy
  units are also in the city). You do not have to remain in the city, it is
  in your control until an enemy unit enters or passes through the city( if
  you have no units in that city). A city with both BLUE and RED units
  in it is considered CONTESTED.

  ATTACKS AND BATTLES:

  When you move any unit adjacent to an enemy unit (not across a river),
  an alarm will sound, a yellow arrow (or arrows) will appear on the
  attacking unit pointing to the unit (or units) under attack, and the MC of
  the attacking unit will be reduced to zero. This is how you attack enemy
  units. Once you move a unit into an enemy's 'zone of control' you can not
  move that unit any more. However you can still cancel the move and the
  attack after dropping the unit by using the cancel button ( see above ).

  You have the option to attack or not attack an enemy unit on the other side
  of a river and you may move past any enemy unit as long as a river divides
  you. If you drop a unit with an enemy unit next to you across a river, the
  alarm will sound and a green arrow will appear on your unit pointing
  to the enemy unit. This message will be in the bottom left of the screen:
  'TO ATTACK PUSH LEFT BUTTON  FOR NO ATTACK PUSH RIGHT BUTTON'.
  If you wish to attack that unit push the LEFT mouse button, the arrow will
  change red and the MC will be reduced to zero. If you don't wish to attack,
  push the RIGHT mouse button, the arrow will disappear and the MC will remain
  unchanged. If you make a mistake, use the cancel button.


  On multi-unit battles the attacker has the option of dividing combat any
  way he wishes as long as the following rules are observed:

  1. If an attacking unit is adjacent to one defender, it must attack that
     defender.
  2. If an attacker is adjacent to two or more defenders, it must attack those
     defenders that are not also adjacent to other attacking units.
  3. The attacker has the option to attack defenders that are also adjacent to
     other attacking units, but an attacker must attack at least one of the
     defenders it is adjacent to.
  4. No defender can be attacked more than once in the same turn and no
     attacker can attack more than once in the same turn.

  These rules may sound confusing, but the computer will keep track of them
  for you.

  ATTACK OPTIONS:

  After you have moved all the units you want and attacked all the enemy
  units you want, push the MOVES DONE button. If there are multi-unit battles
  requiring you to decide how to divide combat, the map will zoom 8 to 1
  to that battle, the attacker will have a yellow arrow pointing to a
  defender shown in reverse video, this message will be in the bottom left of
  the screen 'TO ATTACK PUSH LEFT BUTTON  FOR NO ATTACK PUSH RIGHT BUTTON',
  & a message 'ATTACK OPTIONS LEFT ='will be in the top left of the screen.
  If you wish to attack that unit, push the LEFT mouse button. If not push the
  RIGHT one. This will continue until all attack options have been decided.

								     Page 6


  FIGHTING BATTLES:

  After all options have been selected or after the MOVES DONE button is
  pushed and units have attacked but no options need be selected then we go
  into the battle phase of the game. The map will zoom 8 to 1 to a battle,
  attackers & defenders will be shown in reverse video with  red arrows
  showing the direction of attack. A message at the top left will show, the
  total number of battles to be fought, the battle selected, and the odds of
  that battle.

  A note about odds:

  Each unit has a combat factor as well as a movement count. INF, AIR & MRN
  units have a combat factor of 1 & ARM units have a combat factor of 2.
  Defenders across a river from attackers have their combat factors doubled
  (but only if no other units are attacking them from the defenders side of
  the river). The computer calculates the odds by adding up the total attacker
  and defender combat factors, dividing and giving the fractional remainder to
  the defender. ie: 3.5 to 1 = 3 to 1, 1 to 3.5 = 1 to 4 etc.

  How the computer resolves a battle:

  There are 5 possible results to a battle, they are:

  Attacker eliminated - all attacking units are removed from the game
  Defender eliminated - all defending units are removed from the game
  Attacker back 2 - all attackers must retreat 2 squares
  Defender back 2 - all defenders must retreat 2 squares
  Exchange - all defenders are removed from the game, all attackers equal
	     to the total combat factors of the defenders are removed from
	     the game

  The computer gets a random number from 1 to 6 (ie: rolls a die.) This
  number and the odds of the battle determine the result of the battle.

  The combat result table:

 odds| 1-6 | 1-5 | 1-4 | 1-3 | 1-2 | 1-1 | 2-1 | 3-1 | 4-1 | 5-1 | 6-1
     |------------------------------------------------------------------
    1|Aelim|Aelim|A b 2|A b 2|D b 2|Delim|Delim|Delim|Delim|Delim|Delim
  d 2|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|A b 2| exch| exch| exch| exch| exch|D b 2|D b 2
  i 3|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|D b 2|D b 2|D b 2|Delim|Delim|Delim
  e 4|Aelim|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|A b 2|D b 2|D b 2|D b 2|Delim
    5|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim| exch| exch|D b 2|Delim|Delim
    6|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Aelim|Delim|Delim|Delim|Delim

 Odds greater than 1 to 6 - A eliminated. Odds greater than 6-1 - D eliminated

  SELECT BATTLE button (green):

  You can select the battle you wish to fight first, just push the SELECT
  BATTLE button until you have the battle you desire.

  START COMBAT button (red):

  When you wish to fight a battle push the START COMBAT button. The sight and
  sound of the battle will flash on the screen for a few seconds, then the
  result of the battle will be displayed in a yellow on red message at the
  bottom of the screen.

  COMBAT RESULTS:

  If the result of the battle is Defender or Attacker eliminated, those units
  will disappear from the map, if there are more battles to be fought the
  SELECT BATTLE button will be green , if not, the TURN DONE button will be
  light cyan or light magenta (depending on who's turn it is).

  If the result of the battle is Defender or Attacker back 2 spaces, you must
  pick up those units and move them 2 squares in any direction.(NOTE: if you
  are not able to move the unit 2 squares back, the unit will be removed from
  the map when you drop it. So be sure not to drop the unit until you have
  moved the 2 squares [if you can!].)
  The combat result message will be re-displayed until all units to be moved
  in the battle are moved, then the SELECT BATTLE button or the TURN DONE
  button will light up accordingly.

  If the result of the battle is exchange and the attacker combat factors are
  equal or less then defender factors, all units in the battle are removed
  from the map, if the attackers combat factors are greater then the defender
  you will be asked to pick attacking units to eliminate until the FACTORS
  LEFT message at the top of the screen equals zero. NOTE: If FACTORS LEFT =1
  and the only attacking unit left is an ARMOR unit with a combat factor of 2,
  you have no choice but to eliminate it.

  After all battles have been resolved, push the TURN DONE button.

  The game continues until one country's units are eliminated or it's cities
  captured for one turn.

  EXITING AND SAVING THE GAME:

  You will notice at the start of each turn, the EXIT GAME button lights up
  brown. When you press this button the exit game windows will appear in the
  middle of the map.

  The larger window has 6 options which you can highlight by moving the mouse
  up and down.
  The small window has the name of the current .SAV file (saved game file).
  If there are no saved games, '--NO .SAV FILES--' will be displayed.

								     Page 8


  A description of the 6 options:

  RETURN TO GAME - Does as it says, returns you right back to the game.

  QUIT GAME - Exits the game with out saving. - sends you back to DOS.

  MAKE NEW .SAV FILE - A cursor will appear in the current file window.
		       use the keyboard to enter an 8 character or less
		       file name (don't enter the dot extension ,it's always
		       .SAV and entered automatically). push return (CR) when
		       done. The game will be saved in the new file and you
		       will exit to DOS.
		       Notes: Use the backspace key for corrections.
			      A return with a blank file name will cancel the
			      command.

  SAVE CURRENT FILE - The game will be saved in the file shown in the current
		      file window. If no file is shown, you will hear a buzz
		      and the command will be ignored.

  DELETE .SAV FILE - The file shown in the current file window will be deleted
		     from the disk. If no file is shown, you will hear a buzz
		     and the command will be ignored. If there are other .SAV
		     files on the disk, the next one will be displayed in the
		     current file window. If no other .SAV files are present,
		     '--NO .SAV FILES--' will be displayed.

  SELECT .SAV FILE - If more than one .SAV file exists the next one will be
		     shown in the current file window. After the last one is
		     shown the first one will be redisplayed. If one or no
		     files exist you will hear a buzz and the command will be
		     ignored.


  WINNING THE GAME:

  If you capture all the enemy's units or all his cities for one turn,
  bells will sound and a large message will appear at the bottom of the
  screen declaring VICTORY!! Then pushing any mouse button will exit to DOS.
