             Operation: Vulture
                     
                Instructions
                     
     In the  Middle East,  a group of nations
is attacking  a  U.S.  stronghold  in  Saudia
Arabia, where  a top  secret U.S.  project is
underway, called  "Operation: Vulture."  This
project  is   creating  the  prototype  AH-7A
Vulture,  the   largest  attack   chopper  in
history.    It  holds  six  2000  lb.  bombs,
conventionally used only on jet aircraft, and
1000 rounds of explosive ammo.  This aircraft
capable of  storing  all  this  armament,  is
forty feet  long, and  weighs fifty  thousand
pounds.   Due to this, the rotor must spin so
fast that  it cannot  be seen, even with high
tech camera  equipment.   It goes 500 M.P.H.,
and can  produce G  forces capable of ripping
your head off.
     This helicopter  has never  been tested,
(It never  got off  the ground.)  so  a  very
capable pilot  must be selected.  You are one
of the  four most  capable  pilots  that  are
judged  to   be  good   enough  to  fly  this
completely experimental monstrosity.
     U.S. forces  will be  able to reach this
location in  three weeks,  but radar  reports
enemy  aircraft   travelling  this  direction
already.   Your mission  is to  use  the  top
secret AH-7A  Vulture in  a defensive  attack
against enemy  air  and  ground  forces,  and
clear the  way for  U.S. forces to drive back
the attacking  forces.   During your attempt,
try to  destroy any  enemy  forces  you  can.
Your country is counting on you to succeed.

     When you  start Operation:  Vulture, you
come to  the  Main  Menu.
     Changing speed, and setting  up joystick
can be done  through choice 3 (Options Menu). 
To start the game, select choice 1 (Start the
game) and  a roster  of available pilots will
be displayed.   Use up and down arrow keys to
select the pilot, and Enter, to play the game
with the  selected pilot.   If you would like
to create  a new  pilot, select  a pilot  you
wish to delete and press C.  Then type in the
name of the new pilot (Limit: 24 characters).
If you  press S  on a selected pilot a status
of the  pilot will  appear, telling  you this
pilot's scoring totals.

     When you  play, you  will  see  six  bar
graphs.   These are,  in order Damage, Speed,
Rotor Speed,  Throttle, Fuel, and Ammo.  Then
there is  a graphical  representation of  how
many 2000 lb. bombs you have.   There is also
a  number  in the  lower-right  corner  which
tells you miles from the base.
     When you  become damaged, the efficiency
of your rotor becomes less.  (Your rotor runs
at a  slower speed  than the  throttle)   So,
when  you   are  damaged,  it  requires  more
throttle to keep you in the air.  For repair,
refueling, and  rearming, return  to the base
and land.   You  can be damaged by being shot
by an enemy gun, plane, helicopter, or troop,
hitting  the   ground,  or  being  inside  an
explosion.
.N
     Planes,   and   cruise   missiles   will
occasionally come  and try to get past you to
destroy  your  base  of  operations.    Enemy
helicopters will  try to  destroy you any way
they can.

                    Hints

     It's a  good idea, if you're damaged, to
jettison all  your 2000  lb.  bombs.    These
weigh  down  your  chopper  alot.    Just  be
careful that  you aren't  too  close  to  the
ground  or  you  will  be  destroyed  in  the
explosion.
     If your  fuel goes  below 30%, a warning
tone sounds  which tells  you to  get back to
base and  refuel fast!   It  is a  repeating,
long, low tone.
     When your mission is complete, a mission
complete tone  sounds.  It is a low frequency
pattern which  repeats twice.   It  can't  be
confused with the low fuel tone.
     When you  send an  SOS, a high frequency
pattern of tones sounds (SOS in morse code).
     Operation:  Vulture   runs   faster   in
keyboard mode  (not much,  but a little).  If
you have a slower computer, try this out.
     We tried  to make  the  realism  of  the
flight  controls  and  the  weight  and  drag
formulas  as   accurate  to   real  life   as
possible, so it might be difficult for you to
start out.   Once  you get the hang of it, it
gets  easier.    If  you're  having  alot  of
trouble, try  the training  area.   This will
let you hone your flying and bombing skills.
     Try not  to be gung-ho.  If your chopper
is damaged, but you can still fly it, take it
back to  base anyway.   Your chopper could be
damaged more  if you  keep going.   It  might
cost you  a small amount of time, but it sure
beats being stranded after a crash landing.
     When you  are too damaged to stay in the
air, send  an SOS  to your base, and maneuver
into a  safe position for a crash landing.  A
rescue chopper  will come to save you, and if
you're lucky, they can bring the Vulture back
to base  and repair  it.   If the  Vulture is
destroyed, the  U.S. forces must evacuate the
base, and we will have lost.
     Keep in  mind that  the first  screen to
the  right  is  friendly,  so don't shoot the
buildings there.

     Operation: Vulture  II is available from
H/M  Software  (After  August  1992).   There 
are  many  features  in  the  second  version
including  different  enemies,  and  friendly
support forces,  but the major improvement is
the  area  of  battle  is  generated  by  the
computer, and so are the missions. Therefore,
you will never  play the same mission  twice!
Just send  $6.00 to  the address  on the last
page. If you  have an  idea for a program you
would like to see,  but has  never been  made
before,  send a letter to  the address on the
last page.  If we use your idea, we will send
you  a free copy  of the  program (and future 
versions).  Happy Bombing!
