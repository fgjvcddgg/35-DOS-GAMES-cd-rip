                         Rosenthal UnInstall (tm)

Removes  unwanted  programs,  files,  directories  and  restores  modified 
Registry USER.DAT, SYSTEM.DAT and system AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI 
and  SYSTEM.INI files. Run Rosenthal UnInstall before adding any new  DOS, 
Windows (including Win95, NT and OS/2) software. All new additions may  be 
kept  or deleted with the system completely returned to normal. 

Single  systems,  as  well as networks with multiple  and  even  removable 
drives, are also supported. Safeguards provide display of all  directories 
and  files  (including hidden ones) for review  and  confirmation.  Accept 
additions, or safely delete them.

Rosenthal  UnInstall maintains a map of your disk drives and  records  the 
appearance  of  each  new installation. When  you  execute  "UNINSTAL.EXE" 
before  adding  new  software  to your  system,  Rosenthal  UnInstall  can 
automatically remove it immediately, or selectively at some latter date. 

The best way to determine if any program will satisfy your needs is to try 
it  for  yourself.  Rosenthal UnInstall makes  trying  new  programs  more 
attractive  by  eliminating  the  aggravation  normally  associated   with 
removing unwanted software and restoring the system. Unwanted software  is 
removed   and   the  system  restored  safely   and   automatically.   All 
modifications,   additions  and  deletions  made  to   the   AUTOEXEC.BAT, 
CONFIG.SYS,  WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI and Registry USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT  can 
be restored. At your option, any of the added files and subdirectories may 
be kept or safely deleted, including hidden and read-only files.

                      How to use Rosenthal UnInstall

First copy the files from your distribution diskette, CD-ROM or archive to 
the root directory of your hard disk. 

               For example:
                              COPY A:*.* C:\

Rosenthal Uninstall will work in both a DOS or MS-Windows (including Win95 
and  NT)  environment. That's an important feature, because  if  for  some 
reason  you install a new program which makes changes that causes  Windows 
to  crash, you'll need Rosenthal UnInstall to remove it and  restore  your 
system  files even though Windows may be inoperative. Rosenthal  UnInstall 
can remove some very nasty installations.

Rosenthal UnInstall is designed to remove all versions of Windows software 
including  3.1,  Win95,  NT.  However  it  is  not  dependent  on  Windows 
functioning  and  will  work  independent  of  your  memory,  network  and 
multitasking managers, mouse and graphics drivers.

It's important that your system's time and date are correctly adjusted, so 
please take a moment to make any corrections before proceeding.
 
The  first time you run Rosenthal UnInstall, it will prompt you  to  enter 
your  full name, and your registered serial number. Don't  take  shortcuts 
when entering your real name correctly; you will need to know exactly  how 
it was entered should you require technical support and upgrades. 

This software may be used without a serial number for a limited evaluation 
period  before  paying  the  required registration  fee.  If  you  have  a 
registered copy, enter the serial number exactly as it appears printed  on 
the distribution diskette for each new version when prompted. To try  this 
software  without  a  registered serial number, just press  ENTER  at  the 
serial number prompt. 

Registered  users  receive  the latest version of  this  program  and  the 
unregistered  software  to evaluate listed in the  TRY_THIS.DOC.  See  the 
ORDER.FRM  file for details. Additionally, users receive the  very  useful 
bonus  utility "Rosenthal History (tm)" free with their paid  registration 
or upgrade. 

Rosenthal  Uninstall will map each disk drive as it is logged.  Any  drive 
with read and write access will work including network, fixed,  removable, 
PCMCIA, ram-card and an unlimited number of floppy diskettes. 

Execute  "UNINSTAL.EXE"  before adding each new  software  package.  After 
you've installed and evaluated the new software, you can elect to keep  it 
by  selecting  the "U - Update" function. The map is the updated  and  the 
current time and date are recorded.

Accepting  added software with the "U - update" option also  displays  any 
identical copies on the same disk that may already exist. "U - Update"  or 
"P  - Purge" software before adding anything new. Software that  has  been 
added  to  the  map  using the "Update" function  can  latter  be  removed 
selectively by file name using the "P - Purge" function.

To  remove unwanted software, the "P - Purge" function must be  displayed. 
To  display the function, first  log (or re-log) the disk drive using  the 
"L - Logged drive change" function.

Newly  created  files  display  their  date  and  time  stamps.  You   may 
selectively   "E  -Exempt" files from the removal list. If  you  elect  to 
exempt a file from being purged that resides in a directory that is listed 
for  removal,  the directory is automatically exempted as well.  The  text 
contents  of files being considered for exemption can be  displayed  using 
the "D-Display" option.

When  you elect to "P - Purge" newly installed software that has  modified 
the  AUTOEXEC.BAT,  CONFIG.SYS,  WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI  files  and  Registry 
USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT files are restored automatically. 

When  software  has  been added using the "U - Update"  function,  it  can 
latter  be removed selectively by file name, again using the "P  -  Purge" 
function.  Enter a file name associated this the application.  Wild  cards 
"*"  can be included in the file name and no drive or path name should  be 
included. For example "FILE*.*" will search every directory on the  logged 
drive. When a match is found it will be displayed along with the date  and 
time  of  when it was added to the map. "D - Display" will  show  all  the 
files  added at each session. Again, you can "E - Exempt" any you want  to 
keep.  This is especially true of files that are shared by other  programs 
like run time libraries and .DLL's.

Software  that  has  not yet been added to the map  using  the  "U-Update" 
function  can  be completely uninstalled and the  systems  files  restored 
automatically.  When  software is selectively purged at a latter  date  by 
file  name, the system files may need to be restored manually  using  your 
ASCII  file  editor. The program "Rosenthal History (tm)"  will  show  the 
changes  that  were  made to your system files  so  editing  system  files 
becomes very straight forward and quite simple.

                  Rosenthal History (tm)  (FREE BONUS!)

The  bonus  utility "Rosenthal History (tm)" is included  ABSOLUTELY  FREE 
with  paid  registration or upgrade. It maintains a  running  timeline  of 
changes,  additions  and deletions made to the  AUTOEXEC.BAT,  CONFIG.SYS, 
WIN.INI  and  SYSTEM.INI  files. An easy to understand,  plain  text  file 
(RE_HIST.DAT) history report can be referred to when uninstalling software 
or  to  resolve conflicts. Add Rosenthal History and begin  recording  the 
timeline  as  soon as possible. Read the RE_HIST.DOC file for  a  complete 
description of this very highly acclaimed, "must have" utility.

                           Program Requirements

Rosenthal  UnInstall runs using all versions of MS-Windows including  3.1, 
Win95, NT and/or DOS 3.1 through 7, and OS/2. 

Be  sure  to first copy all the files to the root directory of  your  hard 
drive. Attempting to run this program from a disk that doesn't have  write 
access  (like a CD-ROM or write protected floppy diskette) will  cause  an 
"Access Denied" error.
