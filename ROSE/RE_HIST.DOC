     "I  have  tried several Windows uninstallers  before  running  across 
     Rosenthal  UnInstall and found them slow and somewhat complicated  in 
     the  basic  learning curve. With this little DOS program,  I  had  it 
     installed  and  running in minutes with its short and  to  the  point 
     documentation.  No  frills, no pretty graphics or  pictures  of  your 
     disk, just pure uninstalling power in this package!

     Rosenthal Uninstall not only located all of the files but efficiently 
     removed them in seconds!"

                      How to use Rosenthal History

First copy the files from your distribution diskette, CD-ROM or archive to 
the root directory of your hard disk. 

               For example:
                              COPY A:*.* C:\

Rosenthal  History  shares information with Rosenthal UnInstall  (tm)  and 
Rosenthal  System Monitor (tm). All versions of DOS 3.1 -7 and  MS-Windows 
including Win95 are supported.

Operation is totally automatic and no input is required of the user.  When 
used  with  Rosenthal  UnInstall or the registered  version  of  Rosenthal 
System  Monitor  this  RE_HIST.EXE  is  executed  automatically  and   its 
operation is almost completely transparent to the user. Whenever Rosenthal 
UnInstall updates or purges files, it will also execute Rosenthal  History 
to maintain a running timeline history of additions changes and  deletions 
of your system files.

When  used  with Rosenthal System Monitor, Rosenthal History  will  review 
your  system  files each time you start the system. Rosenthal  History  is 
extremely  fast and will only add updates to your  timeline  (RE_HIST.DAT) 
file as required no matter how often it is run.

System administrators, network managers and technical support people  find 
using  Rosenthal History in combination with Rosenthal System  Monitor  on  
clients systems before they encounter difficulties is extremely helpful to 
resolve problems in the future. Users aren't always aware of changes  made 
to  their system files until it becomes a problem. The  Rosenthal  History 
and System Monitor timeline files RE_HIST.DAT and SYSMON.DAT can be a real 
life  saver  and  turn  disaster into a  simple  and  obvious  correction. 
Installing Rosenthal History and System Monitor on a clients system before 
there are problems can make a consultant look like a real hero when a user 
needs him most.

As  soon  as Rosenthal UnInstall is executed it records  its  timeline  as 
plain  text  file  RE_HIST.DAT.  The indented  outline  format  makes  the 
information in your system files much simpiler to understand. 

Comments  begin  with  ";"  and any changes  are  shown  with  a  complete 
description  of  what was done, the date and time and the  file  that  was 
changed. The indented outline format makes it easy to see exactly what has 
happened  and  when.  When  a line of  your  system  file  gets  modified, 
Rosenthal  History will show very clearly when and where, as well as  what 
the  line  used  to  be  and what is was  changed  to.  Clearly  and  well 
commented.

As  soon  as you install Rosenthal History on your system,  you  take  the 
mystery  out of your DOS and Windows system files. You can then  use  your 
plain  text  editor to changes you would never have attempted  before  and 
keep your system free of junk and running smooth.
