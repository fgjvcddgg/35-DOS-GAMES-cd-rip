     "I  have  tried several Windows uninstallers  before  running  across 
     Rosenthal  UnInstall and found them slow and somewhat complicated  in 
     the  basic  learning curve. With this little DOS program,  I  had  it 
     installed  and  running in minutes with its short and  to  the  point 
     documentation.  No  frills, no pretty graphics or  pictures  of  your 
     disk, just pure uninstalling power in this package!

     Rosenthal Uninstall not only located all of the files but efficiently 
     removed them in seconds!"

                  * * * Rosenthal WINLITE (tm) * * *
                     Compress MS Windows Programs 

Rosenthal   WINLITE  is  a tool for developers  to  compresses  MS-Windows 
programs,  to  dramatically  reduce their  size.  Programs  compressed  by 
Rosenthal   WinLite  are  functionally identical  to the  originals,  only 
smaller. For example, consider the  180k "Solitaire"  game that is bundled 
with  MS-Windows  3.1.  Rosenthal  Winlite compresses  this file  to  less 
than  77k,  or 43% of its original  size.  The smaller,   more   efficient  
programs  save  disk space,  LAN  overhead,  disk  caching  resources  and 
discourage reverse engineering.

Rosenthal  WinLite  inputs a big program... and outputs a small  one.  The 
process  is  totally automatic and requires no additional drivers  and  no 
modification to source code or linking. (WINLITE#).
