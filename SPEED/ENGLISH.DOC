                           -=*SHAREWARE EDITION*=-

    Welcome to SuperSpeed! This speedy miniature car racing game delivers
    pure action for up to four players.
    Challenge your friends or compete against the computer's drivers.
    Eventful tracks with all the obstacles you usually prefer not to find
    in real life driving.

    System requirements

    - a 386 or higher processor
    - VGA graphics card
    - about 550 KB RAM
    - joysticks and Adlib compatible
      sound card optional


    Shareware Edition

    This version of SuperSpeed is shareware. You can try out this program
    as long as you like, and you may give it to your friends. It's free.
    The Shareware Edition is a complete program that certainly will give
    you hours of fun.
    If so, you might want to read the bottom part of this text. You'll
    discover how much SuperSpeed you can get for what little money!


    Installation

    Copy all files from the disk to your hard drive. Use the INSTALL
    program, the MS-Windows file manager or the MS-DOS COPY command.
    No special setup is necessary. If you have a sound card installed,
    SuperSpeed will detect it automatically.

    For users of MS-Windows, files SUPER.PIF and SUPER.ICO are included.
    Use the mouse to drag SUPER.PIF from the file manager to any program
    group in the program manager. Here, you might select SUPER.ICO as
    icon for SuperSpeed.
    Most users will have to start SuperSpeed from DOS, as Windows can slow
    it down or make run quite stumblingly on most PCs.


    The Game

    Start "SUPER". After the title screen, you'll see the "PRESS BUTTON"-
    screen, which will reappear before each track. Join the race with 
    your fire button:

       Player 1 (red car)             LEFT SHIFT KEY
       Player 2 (yellow car)          RIGHT SHIFT KEY
       Player 3 (green car)           JOYSTICK 1 BUTTON
       Player 4 (blue car)            JOYSTICK 2 BUTTON

    As soon as the helicopter leaves the screen, the next race track gets
    displayed. Wait for the lights - ready - steady - go!

    Accelerate with your fire button.
    Release it to brake.

    Your steering wheel looks a bit like:

       red car                        Z left, X right
       yellow car                     cursor left and cursor right
                                      (numeric keyboard 4 and 6)
       green/blue car                 joystick left and right.

    On most tracks, four rounds have to be driven in one race. You'll see
    your current number of laps any time you complete one.

    Aim of the game: reach the finish line before one of the computer's
    drivers does. If you compete against three other human opponents, there
    are no computer drivers; you'll have to beat a qualification time then.
    It's like it always is - some guys get all the points, and some will
    see a large "game over" again and again.
    Don't panic, you may join in again as the next race track begins.

    Race Tracks

    The Shareware Edition includes three, the Deluxe Edition nine great
    race tracks, every single one challenging the driver's skills in a
    different way. Sometimes roads are wide and curves gentle, sometimes
    you must fight arduosly for your way through narrow passages, and
    getting out of a tunnel can become times trickier than entering one.

    Extras

    You'll find a wrench or a 1000-points bonus on the track from time to
    time. Collect four wrenches to enhance your car:

        ACCELERATION      get going faster
        TRACTION          get around those curves at top speed, too
        SPEED             higher top speed
        +4000 Pts         in case you are satisfied with your "equipment"
                          so far, take some points for your wrenches.

    The Bonus-FillUp level of the Deluxe Edition reveals a key sometimes. 
    Collect this to open the gate to the gas station - a flashing bonus sign
    is there. The driver getting there first receives a 1000 points bonus
    and unlocks one of the three secret bonus races. All players compete 
    in the bonus race after the current track.

    Secret Bonus Race (Deluxe Edition only)

    Reach the MEGA-WRENCH, before the countdown score runs down.
    Be alert! Something seems unusual with these bonus tracks...

    Obstacles

    So far, so good. And much too easy for you. So here are some nicely
    unpleasant obstacles adding some flavor to the race:


        puddles           water slows you down a bit, and sliding fun
                          hides in oil patches, sand and ice

        cones             hit 'em hard, and they'll vanish
    
        whirlwind         minding it's own business, as long as you
                          don't get close

        gates             closing regularly, opening, too, although
                          you'll find that hard to admit.
                          when open, they provide a nice shortcut

        skulls            oh-oh. Don't disturb the ghosts of ancient
                          SuperSpeed heroes and their peaceful rest in
                          highscore tables. don't, or they'll send
                          Mr.BadGuy straight from hell
                          hang on, wasn't there a smile some seconds ago?

        blockers          oops, something's growing out of the street.
                          ah, and it's going back. and comes. and goes.
                          obviously can't decide - can you?


    Highscores

    SuperSpeed has two highscore tables. One holds the 30 best SuperSpeeders
    of all time, the other keeps track records for each course.
    Can you beat the existing times and scores ?
    Enter your name there after the race.
