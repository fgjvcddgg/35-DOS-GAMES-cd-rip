                    Distribution Requirements:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Distribution License:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the exclusive North American distributor for Dschump, HomeBrew
Software authorizes on-line distribution only in accordance with
the following restrictions.  Disk Vendors and Distributors should
refer to the VENDOR.DOC text file for complete license
information.

The Dschump package is defined as containing all the
material listed in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files
listed in the PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file
itself, are missing, then the package is not complete and
distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a
complete package suitable for distribution.

    o  The Dschump package - including all related program
       files and documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any
       way (other than that mentioned in the following paragraph)
       and must be distributed as a complete package, without
       exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of
       all files that are part of the Dschump package.

    o  Many BBSs customarily add a small text file
       (advertisement) to each archived file.  This text file
       describes the BBS and tells people that the file was
       downloaded from that particular BBS.  Other BBSs add a

       small one-line message with their BBS name and phone
       number into the compressed file, which will display when
       the file is uncompressed.  Either of these methods of
       mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used,
       provided the program and documentation is otherwise
       unmodified and complete.

    o  HomeBrew Software prohibits the distribution of outdated
       versions of the Dschump package, without written
       permission from HomeBrew Software.  If the version you
       have obtained is over twelve (12) months old, please
       contact us to ensure that you have the most current
       version.

    o  Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify,
       decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or
       transfer the licensed program except as provided in this
       agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall result in
       immediate and automatic termination of this license.

    o  U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or
       disclosure by the U.S. Government of the computer software

BBS Update Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They
get them from other boards, new programs are uploaded by users,
etc.  This is good because most authors cannot afford to mail
disks or upload files to thousands of BBSs.  However, some BBSs
prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you
would like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically,
then please help us to cover the cost.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic upgrades to any of
our products, directly from us, then please refer to the
information below.  Due to the time and expense we are generally
unable to upload directly to a large number of Bulletin Board
Systems.  However, we are able to mail updates on disk (in a
sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic updates then please
take advantage of our BBS Update Program.  Under this program you
can receive updates for an entire year for only $5 per program
(this helps to offset our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with the name and
address of your BBS, your mailing address, the name of the person
we may contact (preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), the program
(or programs) for which you would like to receive updates, and a
check or money order for $5 for each program (for countries
outside of North America please add an additional $5 per
program).  Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank only,
please.

The BBS Update Program is available for the following products
(as of November, 1994):

   Bars
   BrainStorm
   Dschump!
   FinTris
   Flying Tigers
   GateWorld: The Seed Ship
   Puzzle
   Shards
   Star Hammer
   SuperHer for Windows
   World Quest

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will
      automatically receive any NEW programs which we may release
      while their BBS Update Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover our
expenses in those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program
directly from us.  If you have other standard ways to obtain
programs, then you may prefer not to use our BBS Update Program.

Please refer to DESCRIBE.DOC for our mailing address and phone
number.  Thank you for your support!
