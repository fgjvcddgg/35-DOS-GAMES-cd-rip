Dschump! (pronounced 'JUMP') is a fast 'action'/puzzle solving game.
There is no shooting, sorry to all those trigger happy players.
None the less, Dschump! will pull you into a world of wonder, a
world of puzzles.

Aim of the Game:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
The player controls a bouncing ball across a moving world.  The world is
a world of steel and sand, though sand is quite rare.  The creators of this
world saw to it that you will not reach the end, so be yourself and prove
to them that they are not the mighty people they thought they were and
finish all 100 levels.

Each level has some form of puzzle to solve.  Some are easy, some a
hard, some are just outright impossible, but don't despair, it is possible
to solve all the levels.

The aim of each level is to bounce the ball onto the END field.

What is in the world?
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
The steel plate world is floating above a murky-water world, so if the ball
misses the steel surface, YOU DIE!

On this world we find:
o Force fields which change the direction of movement.
o Switches that can create or destroy part of the world.
o Parts of the world are very fragile and break easily, so don't bounce on
  them to often.
o Black holes/Worm holes can transport us from one to another part of
  the world.
o Gems are there for your picking.
o Some special tiles.

How to play:
컴컴컴컴컴컴

Copy the game onto your hard disk and run SETUP.EXE.  Select your preferred
language: English or German.
Then select the computer and graphics card speed.  If you have a joystick
I recommend that you enable the joystick function.  If you have a
SoundBlaster then please select the correct port and interrupt settings.
Save the selections, and lets play.

To play the game run DSCHUMP.EXE.

Once you see the steel world moving in the centre of the screen, you can
use the following keys:
F1 - Keyboard/Joystick selection
F2 - Sound effects On/Off
F3 - Background music On/Off
F4 - Enter a level password.  This lets you skip to any level you
want to.
F5 - See some order info.

When in keyboard mode, press SPACE to start the game.  The level number
will be displayed and the a map of the current level will be drawn on the
right hand side of the screen.

Once the ball is bouncing you can use the cursor keys to control the
movement.

7    8    9

4         6   or the other cursor keys.

1    2    3

Pressing the left SHIFT key lets you move against the world's movement.

When in Joystick mode, press button 1 to start the game.  Button 2 can be
used to move the ball against the world's movement.


What to do:
