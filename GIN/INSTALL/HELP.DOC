Thank you for choosing this program for evaluation.  Every effort has been
made to provide you with a quality entertainment package.  After a short
trial period for evaluation, if you decide to use this software a
registration fee is required.  Run "GINBOOK.EXE" for information.

                             GETTING STARTED

Type "INSTALL" at the DOS prompt to install and set up this program for use.
If you encounter a problem with "INSTALL", you can manually install the
game.  To manually install ULTIMATE GIN you should first create a
directory on your hard disk for your game.   Now use the DOS copy command
to copy the file "GINGAME.EXE" to the directory on your hard disk that you
created for the game.  Next, switch to this directory and type "GINGAME".
This will self extract all game files.  To play the game you need only type
"GIN".  If you have purchased the VOICE PACK for this game, follow the same
procedure substituting "GINVOICE.EXE" for "GINGAME.EXE".
