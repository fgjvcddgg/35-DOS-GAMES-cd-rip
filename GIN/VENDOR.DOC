Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As the exclusive copyright holder for ULTIMATE GIN, ACCIDENTAL 
SOFTWARE authorizes distribution only in accordance with the following
restrictions.

ULTIMATE GIN  - including all related documentation files - CANNOT be
modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete package, without 
exception.

   Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or installation
   batch files used by many shareware disk vendors, are acceptable.

No price or other compensation may be charged for ULTIMATE GIN.  
A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and 
handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed US $8.00 in the 
US and Canada, or US $12.00 internationally.

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ULTIMATE GIN cannot be sold as part of some other inclusive package.  
Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer, without 
a written agreement from ACCIDENTAL SOFTWARE.

   Vendors who wish to distribute ULTIMATE GIN as part of a 
   collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do so 
   provided that all the other restrictions are met.
 
   please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version
   is over twelve (12) months old then please contact us to ensure that you
   have the most current version.  

Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:

restrictions apply:

   Vendors must contact us in advance to ensure that you have the most 
   current version of the software.

   of old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as
   Disk-of-the-Month disks.

ULTIMATE GIN cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.
