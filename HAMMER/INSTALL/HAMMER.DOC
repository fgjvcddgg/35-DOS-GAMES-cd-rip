This file contains a few useful bits of information for STAR HAMMER.


Sound
-----
When STAR HAMMER starts, it attempt to detect the presence of a sound card.
It checks ports 220h and 240h for a SoundBlaster, and port 388h for
an Adlib. If you have another device other than sound card at one of these 
addresses, there is an small chance that you system will 'lock-up'. If this
happens reset your computer, and try typing this to start the game :

HAMMER /NS

the /NS ( No Sound ) turns off the auto-detect mechanism. If you use this 
switch, you will not get ANY sound. If you do have a sound card, and need
to use the switch ( VERY UNLIKELY!! ) go to the Change System Configuration
option at the main menu and select your sound card.

Bugs
----
Through the playtesting phase of STAR HAMMER development, we hope that any
bugs were eliminated. However, if you do find one, please contact Silver 
Lightning Software, or an international agent, and report it.
Please supply as much detail as possible about the nature of the bug, the
machine it is running on, and the version of the software.

The End.
