DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE
-----------------------

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
differ on details -- some request registration while others
require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
using the software to an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
specific group. For example, some authors require written
permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.

DIEBLARNEY! is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to
provide personal computer users with quality software without
high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
continue to develop new products.  If you find this program
useful and find that you are using DIEBLARNEY! and continue to use
DIEBLARNEY! after a reasonable trial period, you must make a reg-
istration payment to Felix Leung.  The registration fee will 
license one copy for use on any one computer at any one time.  
You must treat this software just like a book.  An example is 
that this software may be used by any number of people and may be 
freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as there 
is no possibility of it being used at one location while it's being 
used at another. Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons 
at the same time.

Users of DIEBLARNEY! must register and pay for their
copies of DIEBLARNEY! within 30 days of first use or their license
is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by con-
tacting Felix Leung.

You are encouraged to pass a copy of DIEBLARNEY! along to your
friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered users
will receive a copy of the latest version of the DIEBLARNEY!
system.




THE OMBUDSMAN STATEMENT
-----------------------

This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to
help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an
ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members' products.
Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Rd., Muskegon, MI USA, or
send a Compuserve message via CIS MAIL to ASP Ombudsman 72050,1433.

RUNNING
-------

     DIEBLARNEY! is a very simple game to run, in the fact the all you
     have to do is type DB to start the program.  Then wait and
     let the game continue on with its opening screens. To configure
     DIEBLARNEY! to your system, type config at DOS prompt.
           

TECH HELP & TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------


In simpler terms, if Sound/Music and/or Graphics don't work properly, 
Type Config and press enter. Top to down, select:

Sound and Music: SOUND BLASTER
Port: 220
Interrupt: 5
Sound Driver: sndblast.drv
              .\
VGA Chip Type: AUTO-DETECT

Then select DONE and press enter. If that dosen't work, the specifics 
are below.


Sound And Music:

You need to enter the Port and Interrupt your Sound Blaster is set to use.
(Type config at dos prompt) If you do not know what to choose, try 
experimenting. If the port is wrong, neither music nor sound will work. If
the interrupt is wrong but the port is correct, music will work but sound 
will not.

You also need to  specify a Sound Blaster driver for sound to work. The 
default driver is called "sndblast.drv" and is located in the current
directory (.\). SNDBLAST.DRV and .\ are preinstalled in the two menu fields 
found on the lower left side of the configuration menu. This driver is 
compatible with the "CT-Voice" driver used by Creative Labs' Sound Blaster.

If the preinstalled driver does not work, then use the driver that your sound  
card supplies. Put the driver's full name in the first field 
(e.g., CT-VOICE.DRV), and put its path in the  second  field 
(e.g., C:\sound\).

Video Cards:
  
Ninty-nine percent of the VGA chips will be correctly detected automatically.   
Thus you should leave "AUTO-DETECT" chosen unless you have video problems.  

If during a game you move vertically  and the  character seems to disappear, 
or random dots scroll onto the screen, your VGA chip was incorrectly detected.     
To remedy this problem, select your chip type from the menu.

Video card manufacturers usually obtain their video controller chips from  
one of the chip vendors that this software supports. So if the name of your 
video board isn't on our list, just experiment with different video choices
until one works.

If your board still does not work, choose "Simulate". This option enables a 
software simulation of a VGA card. Use this as a last resort, though, because   
animation in slow computers (386s) may not be as smooth.
