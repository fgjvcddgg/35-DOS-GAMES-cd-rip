 GO -- The Install-From-Diskette Program

 Recommended by Jim Hood's Shareware Marketing System Newsletter.

 If you distribute software or data on diskettes,  you need GO!  The GO program
 acts as a  shell  for dearchiving programs such as  PKUNZIP  or  LHA.  Now you
 don't have to  give people  complicated instructions  for dearchiving, copying
 and installing!  Just tell them, "Put the diskette in your drive and type GO!"
 Everything after that is easy.

 GO can also  display documentation and print reply forms.   It can even search
 the user's hard disk for the  dearchiving program  if you forgot to include it
 on the diskette!

   These top shareware vendors have obtained GO for distributing software...

  Austin ProSoft, BonWare, KelStar, PC-SIG, PD Select, Soft A'ware and others!
