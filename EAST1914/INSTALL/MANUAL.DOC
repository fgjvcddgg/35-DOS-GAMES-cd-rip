        II.  GAME INTRODUCTION

             East Front, 1914 is a simulation of military operations on the
        Eastern Front at the start of World War I.  In this shareware
        version, you command the Eastern Front land forces of the Russian
        empire while the computer "commands" the Eastern Front land forces
        of two of the Central Powers states (the German and Austro-
        Hungarian empires).  The game covers the period of August 15th
        through December 4th, 1914.  During this time period occurred the
        1914 Gallician Battles, the Battle of Tannenberg, the First Battle
        of the Masurian Lakes, and the Battle of Lodz.

             The objective of each player is to occupy key positions in
        enemy territory, while holding key positions in friendly territory.
        A player "wins" the game by outperforming his or her historical
        counterpart (the commanders of the Central Powers forces or the
        Russian forces).

             The registered version of East Front, 1914 allows you to
        play either side against the computer, and allows for two people to
        play against each other (either in person or by exchange of
        electronic files).  For the purpose of play balance the rules for
        the computer opponent games (such as this shareware version) are
        somewhat different than those for the two-player game.

             These instructions are for the shareware version of East
        Front, 1914.  In the shareware version you may only play the
        Russian side against the computer; the 2-player option, Central
        Powers option, and play by E-Mail option are not available.
        Instructions for obtaining the registered version of the game are
        in Section VIII.



        III. COMPUTER OPERATION

        A.   Game Files

             The shareware version of East Front, 1914 consists of several
        files.  The program files are not copy-protected and you may make
        as many backup copies as you feel necessary.  The program files are
        as follows:

        brt70efr.exe   Runtime module necessary for the running of the
                       executable program files (*.exe).

        eastblu2.exe   Executable game program files for playing the
        eastblu3.exe   Russian side against the computer opponent.
                       Requires data from either eastblue.fil, or a saved
                       game file (*.sav).

        eastblue.fil   ASCII data file for starting a new game when you
                       play the Russian side against the computer.

                                                                           3


        rails.fil      ASCII data file for the transportation network.

        1914east.pcx   Graphics files which contain the gameboard map
        info.pcx       and other display data.

        east.bat       Batch file used to start the game.

             You should copy all of the above program files to their own
        subdirectory on the hard disk.  These files are necessary to the
        running of the game.  The subdirectory to which you copy the
        files may be given any name.

             Other files included in the shareware distribution package are
        described below:

        readme.fil     Description of the program, system requirements, and
                       general game instructions.

        memory.fil     Instructions for testing and configuring memory.

        manual.doc     File containing this material (the instruction
                       manual).

        order.fil      Order form for registration.

        see.exe        Freeware file reader from Pinnacle Software.

        amaze.doc      Advertisement from Pinnacle Software.  (Not
                       affiliated with Forgotten Fronts Simulations.)

        amaze.txt      Order form for Pinnacle Software offer.

        manual.bat     Batch file for using the "see" program to read and
                       print the manual.doc file.


        B.   System Requirements

             The game requires an IBM compatible computer with a 286 or
        faster CPU and VGA color display.  The game runs under DOS
        version 4.0 or later and requires 590k of free RAM and 1 MB of
        free expanded memory.  See the file "memory.fil" for more 
        information on memory requirements.


                                                                           4 


        C.   Program Operation

             Using DOS commands, log the computer to the subdirectory which
        contains the program files.  To start the game type east then press
        the <Enter> key.  In response, the program file eastblu3.exe and
        the runtime module will be copied into memory, program execution
        will begin, and the opening menu will be displayed.

             The menu presents two sets of choices.  You must select
        between starting a new game or loading and continuing a saved game,
        and using limited intelligence or full intelligence.  The default
        selections are new game and limited intelligence.  Use the <N> and
        <S> keys to toggle between (N)ew and (S)aved game, the <F> and <L>
        keys to toggle between (F)ull Intelligence and (L)imited
        intelligence.  The asterisks indicate the selected option.  Press
        the <Enter> key when you're ready to start the game.


        Intelligence Options

             Under the full intelligence option all units, including
        opposing player units, are always displayed.  Under the limited
        intelligence option the computer displays only those enemy units
        which are adjacent to the moving player's units or fortresses.


        Saved Game Option

             If you select the saved game option the program will search
        the logged subdirectory for files having the extension of "sav".
        All such files will then be displayed.  If there are no "sav" files
        the program will continue the opening menu display.

             The saved game file naming convention is as follows.  The
        first character of the file name indicates the player who saved the
        game ("b" for blue or Russian).  The next two characters (both
        digits) indicate the game turn which was saved.  For example, a
        file named "b12.sav" contains the game data saved by the blue
        player during move 12.

             Select the file by typing its name.  The program is not case-
        sensitive, so you may enter upper-case or lower-case letters.  You
        need not type the extension name.  Use the <Backspace> key then
        retype to correct any mistakes.  Press the <Enter> key to continue.
        If you type a name for a file which does not exist the program will
        not continue.  Type a new file name over the displayed erroneous
        name.  Use the space bar to erase extraneous characters.

             You may return to the opening menu from the saved game
        selection menu by pressing the <Enter> key when no file is
        selected.  Use the <Backspace> key or spacebar to clear a file name
        from the file selection field.

                                                                           5
 

        Difficulty Option (computer opponent)

             When playing against the computer you may set a "difficulty"
        level to improve play balance.  The standard setting is 1.  Setting
        0 makes the game easier by reducing the computer side's per turn 
        replacement steps.  Settings 2 and 3 make the game more difficult
        by increasing the computer side's per turn replacement steps.



        IV.  GENERAL GAME INFORMATION

        A.   Map

             The gameboard is a map consisting of 1,681 offset squares
        representing the eastern part of the German empire, the
        northeastern part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the western
        part of the Russian empire, and the northwestern part of Romania as
        of August, 1914.  Each square represents an area of approximately
        13 by 13 miles (which is about 20 square kilometers).  The squares
        are offset so that each borders on six other squares.  The squares
        are identified with "x" and "y" axis numbers.  The x-axis
        represents columns which are numbered left to right from 2 to 42.
        The y-axis represents rows which are numbered top to bottom from 2
        to 42.  Column 1 and row 1 contain map edge squares which are not
        playable.

             Please keep in mind that the map square lines do not appear on
        the computer display.  Map squares are distinguished by terrain
        icons and in the case of clear terrain, a small black dot.  The x,y
        coordinates for the cursor map square position are displayed in the
        lower-left area of the screen.

             Terrain features are identified by symbols.  Off-white map
        squares with no symbols, only a small black dot, contain clear
        terrain (plains, crop land, and fields).  Brown bordered, aqua
        lines along square edges represent rivers.  Terrain affects
        movement and combat.  Terrain types in East Front, 1914 are
        woods, hills/rough, bog/marsh, major city, minor city, mountain,
        and hills/woods (combined hills and woods).

                  WOODS.  Woods terrain affects both combat and movement.
                  Units in woods squares are not forced to retreat if
                  they incur a combat loss.  Also, units in clear squares
                  may not retreat into woods squares.  Units must expend
                  more movement factors to traverse woods squares than
                  clear squares.  You may not have more than one unit in
                  a woods square.

                  MAJOR CITY.  Units attacking major city squares have
                  their attack factors halved.  Major cities do not
                  affect movement.

                                                                           6


                  MINOR CITY.  Minor city squares are the same as clear
                  terrain squares for combat and movement purposes.

                  HILLS/ROUGH.  Hills/Rough terrain affects both combat and
                  movement.  Units attacking from clear squares into
                  hills/rough squares have their attack factors reduced
                  by one third.  Units in hills/rough squares are not
                  forced to retreat if they incur a combat loss.  Also,
                  units in clear squares may not retreat into hills/rough
                  squares.  Units must expend more movement factors to
                  traverse hills/rough squares than clear squares.  You may
                  not have more than one unit in a hills/rough
                  square. 

                  MOUNTAINS.  Mountain terrain affects both combat and
                  movement.  Units attacking into mountain squares have
                  their attack factors halved.  Units in mountain squares
                  are not force to retreat if they incur a combat loss.
                  Also, units in clear squares may not retreat into
                  mountain squares.  Units must expend all of their
                  movement factors to enter a mountain square.  You may not
                  have more than one unit in a mountain square.  Also, all
                  units in mountain squares are unsupplied unless there is
                  an operational transportation line running through those
                  squares.

                  BOG/MARSH.  Bog/Marsh terrain affects both combat and
                  movement.  Units in bog/marsh squares are not forced to
                  retreat if they incur a combat loss.  Also, units in
                  clear squares may not retreat into bog/marsh squares.
                  Units must expend more movement factors to traverse
                  bog/marsh squares than clear squares.  You may not have
                  more than one unit in a bog/marsh square.


                  HILLS/WOODS.  Hills/Woods squares are the same as
                  hills/rough squares for combat and movement purposes.


        Other types of map squares are the aqua colored sea squares, the
        two Masurian lake squares (map locations 21,8 and 21,10), and the
        dark gray colored Romania squares.  Movement into these squares
        is prohibited.

             Rivers, as stated previously, are represented by brown
        bordered, aqua lines running along square sides.  Rivers affect
        both combat and movement.  Units attacking across rivers have their
        attack factors reduced by one third.  Also, units may not retreat
        across rivers.  Units must expend an additional movement factor to
        cross rivers.

             The "transportation network" available for unit supply is
        shown by solid, dark gray, straight lines.  These lines represent
        all-weather roads and major rail lines.
                                                                           7


        B.   Units and Fortresses

             The playing pieces for East Front, 1914 are markers
        representing two types of units, infantry and cavalry.  German
        units are red, Austro-Hungarian units are orange/tan, and Russian
        units are blue.  German unit designations show whether a unit is 
        an active unit (A), a reserve unit (R), or a second-line reserve
        unit known as Landwehr (LW).  Russian and Austro-Hungarian units
        are not designated in this manner.


                  INFANTRY.  Infantry units may attack infantry, cavalry,
                  and fortresses.  Infantry units which sustained losses
                  may receive replacements.  Infantry unit markers
                  represent corps (40,000-45,000 troops), divisions
                  (15,000-17,000 troops), and brigades (5,000-6,000
                  troops).

                  CAVALRY.  Cavalry units may only attack other cavalry
                  units, but may defend against attacks by both infantry
                  and cavalry.  Cavalry units may not participate in any
                  attack on a fortress square, and may not receive
                  replacements.  Cavalry unit markers represent divisions
                  (about 7,000 troops).


             Each unit has a combat factor, a strength factor, and a
        movement factor.  Combat value is a function of the combat and
        strength factors.  When the program identifies a friendly unit,
        these factors are displayed as a set of three numbers.  For
        example, a full-strength German active division will be shown
        with unit factors of 12-2-3.0.  This indicates a combat factor of
        12, a strength factor of 2, and a movement factor of 3.0.

             Units which incur combat losses, or losses due to lack of
        supply, are reduced in strength.  Each unit has one or more
        strength "steps" through which it may be reduced by combat, or
        built up with replacements.  The strength factor displayed
        represents the number of remaining steps.

             For infantry units each step represents the approximate
        effectiveness of one brigade.  Note that the last step for a unit
        has no combat value (strength factor of 0).  When a unit is reduced
        to its last step all of the subordinate combat elements have lost
        effectiveness.  All that remains functional in the unit are the
        service and support elements.  Any further loss destroys the unit.
        Once a unit is destroyed it may not be revived.

             Fortresses are represented by light purple, diamond shaped
        icons.  Any type of land square, including city squares, may
        contain fortresses.  Fortresses hold map squares for the owning
        player and offer protection and supply for friendly units.
        Fortresses have three strength levels, 1 (weakest) through 3
                                                                           8


        (strongest).  Attacking infantry, if successful, may destroy
        fortresses by reducing their strength one level at a time.  When
        strength level is reduced to 0 the fortress is destroyed.  After
        a fortress is destroyed the diamond shaped icon is no longer
        displayed.


        C.   Keyboard Controls

             Game operation is controlled by the keyboard and, if
        connected, a mouse.  Cursor movement, unit movement, and combat
        operations are controlled by the numeric keys 7-9, and 1-3 or a
        Microsoft compatible mouse and mouse driver.  Presence of an active
        mouse will be detected by the program.  If no active mouse is

        detected then the NumLock function key will be activated and
        movement will be controlled by the numeric keys.  If an active
        mouse is detected the NumLock function key will not be enabled
        and you will not be able to use the numeric keys for movement and
        combat operations.  Functions other than unit operations and cursor
        movement are controlled by the alphabetic keys.  Following is a
        description of all key functions.


        M         MENU.  Brings up a menu of play options during the
                  movement phase, the combat phase, and the replacement
                  phase.  Movement phase options are end move (advance to
                  combat selection phase), save game, game status
                  (victory conditions), and quit to the main menu.

        O         OVERVIEW.  Displays the full map showing square
                  possession.  Functions during the movement phase only.
                  The fortress squares of Konigsberg, Danzig, Lemberg,
                  Krakow, Przemsyl, Kovno, Lodz, and Warsaw are represented
                  by black outlined boxes.  The city squares of Posen,
                  Breslau, Budapest, Vienna, Minsk, and Vilna are
                  represented by solid black squares.

        P         POSSESSION DISPLAY.  Toggles on/off the display of square
                  possession markers.  It is selectable during the movement
                  phase only.  Central possession is shown by a red dot,
                  Russian possession is shown by a blue dot.

        T         TRANSPORTATION NETWORK DISPLAY.  Toggles on/off the
                  display of the transportation network.  It is
                  selectable during the movement phase only.  Squares
                  that are part of a player's transportation network are
                  shown with a circle.

        Q W E     AREA DISPLAY.  These keys change the display by quickly
        A S D     moving the cursor to a different section of the
        Z X C     mapboard.  For example, the <Q> key moves the cursor to
                  the upper-left section of the map, the <C> key moves
                  the cursor to the lower-right section of the map.
                                                                           9 


        Keypad    UNIT/CURSOR MOVEMENT.  The numeric keys move the cursor
        7 8 9     one square at a time.  The cursor is usually a black
        1 2 3     box which outlines the highlighted square.  When a unit
                  or square is selected with the <Enter> key the cursor
                  color changes to yellow.  The numeric keys move the
                  cursor as follows: 7-NW, 8-N, 9-NE, 1-SW, 2-S, 3-SE. 
                  If an active mouse is detected then these keys are
                  disabled.  You may either use mouse unit/cursor
                  movement or keyboard unit/cursor movement but not both.
                  See Mouse Control on the next page.

        U         UNDO.  Cancels, or "undoes" the movement of a unit.
                  The unit is returned to its starting position and its
                  movement allowance is restored.  You must undo a unit's
                  move before you select another unit for movement.  The
                  undo feature can't be used for units which moved adjacent
                  to enemy possessed squares.

        Alt-Q     QUIT TO DOS.  During the movement phase when you press
                  the <Q> key while holding down the <Alt> key the
                  program will terminate returning you to the DOS prompt.


        D.   Mouse Control

             To move the cursor (usually a black square), position the
        white mouse pointer over the square to be selected.  Press the
        <LeftMouse> button and the cursor will move to the selected
        square (the square on which the mouse pointer rests).  To examine
        or "select" the square on which the cursor now rests, press the
        <RightMouse> button when the mouse pointer is on that square.
        (In effect, the <RightMouse> button functions the same as the
        keyboard <Enter> key.)  Note:  To choose between two friendly units
        in a selected square, use the <LeftMouse> button to select the top
        unit, the <RightMouse> button to select the bottom unit.

             To scroll the map, place the mouse pointer on a fully
        displayed map edge square (about 1/2 inch in from the map edge)
        then press the <LeftMouse> button.


        E.   Play Sequence

             Each game turn represents a half week of operations and
        consists of a Russian (blue) turn and a Central (red) turn.  The
        game begins with the Russian player's turn.  After completion of
        all phases of the Russian player's turn, the Central player's
        turn begins.  The game advances a full game turn after completion
        of all phases of the Central player's turn.  The first full game
        turn of a new game represents August 15 through August 17, 1914.
        The second full game turn represents August 18 through August 21,
        1914.  The game continues, with alternating blue and red turns,
        through December 4, 1914, game turn 33.

                                                                          10


             Each player turn consists of several stages called "phases."
        The phase sequence is as follows: supply, Russian mobilization
        (Russian player turns 2 through 5), replacement, movement, combat
        selection, enemy defense option selection, and combat resolution.
        During the first game turn, August 15-17, there is no replacement
        phase. 


        Supply

             The computer determines which units are in supply and which
        units are cut off.  A unit is in supply if there is a continuous
        line of friendly squares from the unit to a supply base.
        Isolated units which are in fortresses are also in supply; however,
        they may not receive replacements.  Supply bases for the Central
        player are the west map edge squares, the south map edge squares,
        the coastal city squares (Danzig, Konigsberg, and Memel), and
        Krakow (but only so long as Krakow's fortress is intact).  Supply
        bases for the Russian player are the east edge map squares, Dvinsk,
        and Warsaw (but only so long as all three Warsaw square fortresses
        are intact).  On the second consecutive turn that a unit is out of
        supply it loses a step.  A step is lost for each subsequent turn
        that the unit is cut off.  Units may be destroyed through loss of
        supply.  A supply base square does not function as a supply base
        while it is possessed by the opposing side.

             In addition to unit supply, there is also map square supply.
        Each square has a supply value of from 0 (the lowest value) to 9
        (the highest value).  A square supply value of 3 is needed for a
        Russian corp to receive mobilization augmentation.  A square supply
        value of at least 5 is needed for a unit to receive replacements.
        A square supply value of 3 is needed for a square to be used for
        rail movement (available only for German units).  Unsupplied
        squares have a supply level of 0.

             When a square changes possession it is assigned a supply value
        of 2 less than the supply value of the square from which the
        occupying unit moved.  For example, when a German unit moves from a
        square with a supply value of 6 to a square possessed by the
        Russian player, the Russian square changes to a German square and
        is given a temporary supply value of 4.  During the supply phase
        each square which is cut off from a supply base has its supply
        level set to 0.  Each square which is in supply has its supply
        level increased by 1, up to the maximum of 9.  This increase in
        supply level represents the clearing of roads and the repair of
        bridges and railroad track.

             The maximum supply level of a square is determined by its
        location in relation to the owning player's transportation network.


                                                                          11
     

        Russian Mobilization

             Combat operations commenced on the Eastern Front prior to
        the completion of Russian mobilization.  Accordingly, the game
        begins with some incomplete Russian corps.  These units are
        marked with a "-" in the unit display.  These corps receive their
        missing forces during the Russian Mobilization phase of game
        turns 2 through 5.  This augmentation is handled automatically by
        the computer program.  During each of these four turns, 2 or 3 of
        the incomplete Russian corps may receive their mobilization
        augmentation.  Note, however, that an incomplete corp must be in 
        a square with a supply value of at least 3 to actually receive
        its mobilization augmentation.  If during its scheduled
        mobilization augmentation turn a corp is not in a square with a
        supply level of at least 3, then that corp doesn't receive such
        augmentation.


        Replacements

             After the first full game turn (starting August 18th) the
        Central player may provide replacements for eligible units which
        have been reduced in strength.  Russian replacements begin on the
        sixth game turn (September 1st).  A Russian or Austro-Hungarian
        unit is eligible for replacements if it is not adjacent to an enemy
        unit and is in a square with a supply level of at least 5.  A
        German unit is eligible for replacements if it is in a square with
        a supply level of at least 5.  (A German unit adjacent to a Russian
        unit may receive replacements.)  A unit may not receive more than 1
        replacement step each replacement phase.  If there are 2 eligible
        units in a square, only 1 of those units may receive replacements
        during a replacement phase.  Replacements for units are controlled
        by the appropriate player.

             Initially, 3 replacement steps per turn are available for
        Austro-Hungarian and Russian units, and 1 replacement step per turn
        is available for German units.  As the game progresses the number
        of replacement steps available each turn changes (increases for the
        Germans and Russians, decreases for the Austro-Hungarians).


        Movement

             During this phase players may move some, none, or all of their
        units.  Russian garrison divisions, however, may not be moved until
        they come into contact with Central units or until after game turn
        14.  Also, only German units may move by rail.

             Reinforcements (new units) arrive at the beginning of certain
        movement phases.  Newly arrived units may be moved.  A notice is
        displayed at the start of each movement phase for which
        reinforcements are scheduled.

                                                                          12 


        Combat Selection

             After completion of the movement phase, the moving player
        selects which if any units will attack enemy units.  All attacks
        are at the option of the moving player.  Cavalry units may attack
        other cavalry units but not infantry units.  Also, cavalry units
        may not participate in attacks on fortress squares.


       Enemy Defense Option Selection  (2-Player Version Only)

             During this phase the opponent of the moving player selects
        combat responses for the attacked units.  The three defense options
        generally available to attacked units are withdrawal, normal
        defense, and hold at all costs.

             The hold option is available only to units with at least one
        strength step remaining and applies only to such units located in
        clear and city squares.  Russian units may not "hold" in clear
        terrain; they may "hold" only in city squares (both major and
        minor).  If this option is selected and the attack is successful,
        the defending unit is not compelled to retreat.  Instead, the
        defending unit holds its ground and losses 2 strength steps (as
        casualties) instead of 1 strength step.

             Units in attacked squares may withdraw and thus avoid
        combat.  The attacking units advance into such vacated squares
        during the combat resolution phase.  An attacking unit incurs no
        casualty loss when it advances into a vacated square.  Units may
        not be withdrawn into occupied friendly squares in violation of any
        1-unit stacking limitation (woods, hills, mountain, and swamp
        squares).


        Combat Resolution

             After completion of the movement phase (completion of the
        enemy defense options selection phase for the 2-Player version of
        the game) the game advances to the combat resolution phase.  The
        computer handles the resolution of all combat (losses, retreats,
        and advances into vacated squares).

             The result of each battle is displayed.  The display
        includes a basic representation of the attacked square and the
        six adjacent squares.  Information displayed includes the
        designation of the principal combat units (one for each side),
        combat odds, combat results, and the new strength values for
        units which incur losses.  Note that attack odds greater than 4:1
        are treated as 4:1.  This odds limitation reflects the mismatch
        between technology (machine guns and rapid-fire artillery) and
        combat doctrine and tactics which existed at the start of World
        War I.  There is a separate combat display for attacks on
        fortresses.

                                                                          13


        V.   GAME ELEMENTS

        A.   Supply

             Supply determination takes place after the resolution of
        combat.  As previously stated, a unit is "in supply" if there is
        a continuous line of friendly squares from that unit to a supply 
        base, or the unit is in a fortress square.  A unit cut off from
        supply loses a strength step beginning with the second turn it is
        out of supply.  Step losses continue until a supply line is re-
        established or the unit surrenders (is destroyed).  Surrendered
        units are reflected in the "captured" count displayed by the game
        status screen.


        Bases

             Supply bases for each side are described in Section III. E.,
        Play Sequence.  Once a supply base square is occupied by an enemy
        unit that square no longer functions as a supply base.  The
        square will again function as a supply base if it is reoccupied
        by a friendly unit.  City supply bases and map-edge bases that
        are part of the transportation network have a maximum supply
        level of 9.


        Transportation Network and Maximum Supply

             Supplies are moved from depots to units by railroad and
        animal-drawn carts.  Supplies move through a pipeline-like
        network consisting of major railroad lines and all-weather roads.
        The closer a unit is to this "pipeline" the faster it can receive
        the supplies necessary to conduct operations (munitions, food,
        and animal fodder).  These logistics aspects of the campaign are
        embodied in the transportation network rules.

             The transportation network is represented by solid gray
        lines.  The maximum supply level for squares in this network is
        9.  Maximum supply is attained when the square is part of a
        friendly network reaching back to a supply base square (city or
        map-edge).  The maximum supply level that a square can have
        decreases by 2 for each square it is distant from the
        transportation network.  For example, a square that is one square
        from the transportation network has a maximum supply value of 7.  A
        square that is two squares from the transportation network has
        a maximum supply value of 5.  Squares that are four or more squares
        from the transportation network have a maximum supply value of 1.

             There is an exception to the general transportation network
        rule.  The exception is for the Russian city of Pinsk (35,18).
        If this square is in possession of the Russian player it has a
        maximum supply value of 7.  Squares adjacent to Pinsk have a
        maximum supply value of 5, squares that are two squares from
        Pinsk have a maximum supply value of 3.
                                                                          14


        B.   Replacements

             Beginning with the second Central game turn (sixth game turn
        for the Russian player) and prior to each player's movement
        phase, each player may designate certain units to receive 
        replacements.  In order for a unit to receive replacements it
        must be in a map square with a supply level of at least 5, not
        adjacent to an enemy unit (unless the unit to receive replacements
        is a German unit), and otherwise eligible to receive replacements.
        Cavalry units may not receive replacements.  No more than one unit
        in a map square may receive replacements during one game turn.  A
        unit may not receive more than one replacement step during one game
        turn.  Replacement allocation for Central and Russian units is
        controlled by the respective player.

             At the start of the game there are 3 replacement steps
        available each turn for the Austro-Hungarian and Russian units.
        There is 1 replacement step available for the German units.

             The number of replacement steps available changes as the
        game progresses.  Beginning October 1st, the number of German
        replacement steps increases to 2 and the number of Russian
        replacement steps increases to 4.  Beginning November 1st, the
        number of German replacement steps increases to 3 and the number of
        Austro-Hungarian replacement steps decreases to 2.

             To select a unit to receive replacements, place the cursor
        over that unit.  If the unit is eligible for replacements
        "Eligible" will appear in the message area at the bottom of the
        screen.  Press the <Enter> key or the <RightMouse> button.  If the
        square is occupied by an eligible unit in the square the cursor
        color will turn to yellow.  If there is no eligible unit then the
        cursor will blink.  If there are two eligible units in the selected
        square you will be asked to chose either the top unit or bottom
        unit.  Press the <T> key or <LeftMouse> button to select the top
        unit; press the <B> key or the <RightMouse> button to select the
        bottom unit.  Finally, you will be asked to confirm your
        replacement decision.  Press the <Y> key to answer yes, the <N> key
        to answer no.

             After a player has allocated all available replacements, the
        program advances to the movement phase.  If you want to terminate
        the replacement phase (because there are not enough eligible
        units for the available replacement steps) press the <M> key (for
        "menu") and then respond to the question with the <Y> key.  Note:
        Unused replacements are "lost"; they are not carried forward to
        other game turns.


                                                                          15


        C.   Reinforcements

             During the game each side receives additional units known as
        reinforcements.  The arrival of reinforcements is controlled by the
        game program.  Reinforcements arrive and appear on the map at the
        beginning of each game turn.

             At the start of the August 25-28 game turn the Central
        player is asked whether the Germans will receive early
        reinforcement from the Western Front.  The units affected are the 
        Guard reserve corp, the 11th active corp, and the 8th cavalry
        division.  If the Central player selects the early reinforcement
        option, then these units will arrive on the September 1-4 game turn
        (historical option).  Otherwise, these units will arrive on the
        October 8-11 and October 26-28 game turns.

             Some units arriving as reinforcements have a movement bonus
        (movement allowance of between 7.0 and 9.5).  This reflects the use
        of railroads to bring mobilized units to designated deployment
        positions.  Newly arrived units with these extra movement factors
        may not attack on that turn (their initial combat factor is 0).


        D.   Movement

             All units may be marched (foot and horse movement) and
        German units may be moved by railroad in Germany and western
        "Poland." Rail movement is so limited because only the Germans had
        both the staff capability and the rail resources for the impromptu
        rail movement of forces.


        Basic Movement (March)

             Each unit has a basic movement allowance called a movement
        factor.  Movement points are expended from the movement factor as a
        unit moves across map squares.  After the movement factor is
        exhausted that unit can no longer move.  It costs 1 movement
        point to move into clear terrain and city map squares.  It costs
        1.5 movement points to move into hill, forest, and swamp map
        squares.  It costs an additional 1.0 movement point to cross a
        river.  Moving into a mountain square costs all of a unit's
        movement factor and the mountain movement must be the only movement
        that the unit makes that turn.

             Generally, a unit must have a movement factor sufficient to
        enter the map square into which the player wants to move that unit.
        The exception to this rule is that if a unit has not moved during a
        movement phase it may move into any square by expending all of it's
        movement points.  For example, an infantry unit with a movement
        factor of 2.0 may be moved across a river into a woods square
        (movement cost of 2.5 points) so long as it is the first move for
        that infantry unit during that movement phase.

                                                                          16


             To select a unit for march movement, move the black cursor
        to that unit's map square then press the <Enter> key or the
        <LeftMouse> button.  The cursor color will change to yellow to show
        that the map square has been selected.  If the map square contains
        2 units then select either the top unit or bottom unit for movement
        by pressing the <T> key / <LeftMouse> button or the <B> key /
        <RightMouse> button.

            Unit movement is accomplished by using the numeric keypad keys
        (1,2,3 and 7,8,9) or the mouse pointer.  To move a unit using the
        mouse, place the mouse pointer over an adjacent square then press
        the <LeftMouse> button.  If the selected unit is unable to enter
        the desired map square, then the cursor color or mouse pointer will
        blink and the unit will not be moved.

             To de-select a unit from march movement press the <Enter>
        key or the <RightMouse> button.  In response the cursor color
        will change from yellow to black.


        German Landwehr Brigades

             The German forces begin the game with 6 Landwehr brigades.
        During the actual campaign these units were "built up" to 3 corps
        using Landsturm units (3rd line reserve forces) and additional
        Landwehr units.  At the beginning of the Central player's 15th
        turn, October 1-4, the 6 Landwehr brigades are replaced by 3
        Landwehr corps.


        E.   Romania

             Romania remains neutral throughout the game.  Units may not
        move into Romania.  Central and Russian units may not withdraw or
        retreat into Romania.


        F.   Combat

             The combat phase of a game turn follows the movement phase.
        To end the movement phase and begin the combat phase, first display
        the game menu by pressing the <M> key.  Then select the End
        Movement option by pressing the <E> key.  Confirm the selection by
        pressing the <Y> key.

             During the combat phase, the moving player selects friendly
        units to conduct attacks against enemy units and fortresses.  The
        moving player may select some, all, or none of the friendly units
        to participate in attacks.  Also, more than one unit may attack a
        target; however, a unit may not attack more than one enemy target.
        To end combat selection, display the game menu by pressing the <M>
        key then press the <Y> key in response to the "end selection"

                                                                          17


        question.  The computer will then calculate combat odds and resolve
        combat.  Combat odds and results are displayed on the screen for
        each attack.


        Fortress Attack

             Fortresses can be attacked only by infantry.  If a fortress is
        destroyed, an enemy unit in the fortress square is unaffected by
        the fort's destruction unless additional infantry units 
        participated in the attack.  For example, a German infantry corp
        attacks a Russian infantry division located in a fortress.  The
        fortress may be destroyed but the Russian division will not be
        affected by the attack because the German infantry corp was
        employed in attacking the fortress and not the Russian division.
        If, however, the same Russian square was attacked by two German
        corps and the fortress were destroyed, then the Russian division
        could by attacked by the second German corp.

             German active divisions and corps have a 20% to 65% chance
        of reducing a fortress in any given fortress attack.  Odds depend
        on the fortress strength level.  All other infantry units have only
        a 20% chance of reducing a fortress during an attack.  The
        advantage of the German active units is due to the 155mm and
        210mm heavy artillery found in such units.


        Unit Combat

             To select a unit for attacking place the cursor over the
        chosen unit; then press the <Enter> key or the <RightMouse>
        button (in response the cursor color changes to yellow).  Next
        select the attack direction by using the numeric keys or the
        mouse and the <LeftMouse> button (attack arrow displayed on the
        screen).  Then press the <Enter> key or <RightMouse> button to
        store the combat selection.  Infantry units can attack infantry
        units and cavalry units; cavalry units can attack cavalry units
        only.

             To de-select a unit from attacking, place the cursor over
        the chosen unit; press the <Enter> key or the <RightMouse>
        button; then press the <Y> key to select the cancel attack
        option.

             An attacked square is defended by the units in that square.
        If there are two units defending, the program will designate one of
        the units as the lead defending unit.  The combat value of both
        units, however, will be taken into account in the determination of
        the combat result.

                                                                          18


        Combat Resolution

             The computer program resolves each attack taking into
        account unit strength, terrain, and the orders received by the
        defending unit (defend, hold, withdraw).  Results are displayed
        separately for each attack.


        Fortress Attack:    The attacking units are identified in the upper
                            right portion of the combat resolution display.
                            If the attacking unit takes casualties its new
                            combat, strength, and movement factors are
                            displayed. 

        Unit Attack:        The lead attacking and defending units are
                            identified in the combat resolution display.
                            Though the program accounts for all units
                            involved in each attack, only one unit for each
                            side is identified.  If the lead attacking or
                            defending unit takes casualties its new combat,
                            strength, and movement factors are displayed.
                            Also displayed is the total combat value for
                            each side engaged in the attack and the odds of
                            the attack (attack combat value v.  defense
                            combat value).  Odds are rounded down to .2:1,
                            .3:1, .5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1.  Due to the
                            advantage of defense at the time, attack odds
                            never exceed 4:1.  (Though if a unit has a
                            defense value of 0 the odds will be shown as
                            9:1.) Combat value is based on a formula in
                            which roughly the combat factor is multiplied
                            by the strength factor and the product is
                            adjusted for terrain.  Also, the combat value
                            of defending units is increased when the lead
                            defending unit is a German corps or infantry
                            division.  For example, the attack value of a
                            German active corp is 120; the defense value of
                            such unit is 164.  The attack and defense value
                            of an 8-3-3.0 Russian corp is 56, while the
                            attack and defense value of a 6-3-2.5 Russian
                            corp is 42.



        VI.  VICTORY CONDITIONS

        A.   2-Player Game (included in the registered version)

             As stated in the Introduction, each player's goal is to
        achieve victory on the Eastern Front through possession of
        geographic positions.  The objectives for the Central player are
        all the German cities, Vienna, Budapest, Krakow, certain Carpathian
        Mountain squares (23,37 23,38 27,39 and 27,40), Lodz, and either

                                                                          19


        Vilna or a Warsaw square.  The objectives for the Russian player
        are Minsk, Vilna, Kovno, Warsaw, Kholm, Brest-Litovsk, Czernowitz,
        Tarnapol, Lemberg, Przemsyl, Gorlice, Tarnow, and any one major
        German city, or Katowice and Krakow.  The Russian player may also
        win a "sudden death" victory by occupying a Vienna or Budapest
        square.  Except for the Russian sudden death situation, to win you
        must control, at the end of the game, all of the objective
        positions while denying victory to your opponent.  Keep in mind
        that at the end of the game all squares (including fortress
        squares) which are surrounded by enemy possessed squares "fall" to
        the enemy player.

             Victory is normally determined at the end of the game (after
        33 game turns).  The last game turn is December 1-4.  After full
        completion of the 33rd turn, a final game status report will be 
        displayed.  The display shows which objectives were met as well
        as the casualties incurred by each side.  Casualties do not
        affect victory calculations; casualties are presented for
        information only.  (During the 1914 Eastern Front campaign
        Central Powers casualties totaled approximately 1,100,000,
        Russian casualties totaled approximately 1,800,000.  Casualty
        figures include killed, wounded, captured, and missing.)

             During the movement phase a player may apprise each side's
        progress in attaining victory by viewing the game status display.
        The display is called by pressing the <M> key (for "menu") then the
        <G> key.  Objectives achieved by the Central player are displayed
        in red while objectives achieved by the Russian player are
        displayed in blue.


        B.   Computer Opponent Games

             In order to achieve play balance the victory conditions are
        somewhat different when you play against the computer.  Following
        are the victory conditions which apply only to playing the
        Russian side against the computer (this shareware version).

             The Russian objectives are all the Russian cities except for
        Lodz, Czernowitz, Tarnapol, Lemberg, Przemsyl, Gorlice, Tarnow,
        Krakow and either Konigsberg, Danzig, a Vienna square or a Budapest
        square.  The computer player (Central Powers) objectives are all
        the major German cities, Vienna, Budapest, Krakow, the Carpathian
        Mountain squares of 23,38 and 27,40, Brun and either Vilna or a
        Warsaw square.  Also, the game will come to an end before
        completion of game turn 33 if the computer player possesses Vilna
        or a Warsaw square.  This early termination is not a sudden death
        victory for the computer player.  The computer player (Central
        Powers) must attain all of its objectives, not just Vilna or a
        Warsaw square, in order to achieve victory.


                                                                          20


        VII. COMPUTER OPPONENT PLAY

             Though East Front, 1914 was designed as a 2-player game, you
        may play either the Central or the Russian side against the
        computer.  (The shareware version which you have permits play
        only as the Russian side against the computer.)  When you play
        against the computer you may set the level of play difficulty.
        Level 1 is the standard difficulty level.  Decreasing the
        difficulty level to 0 makes it easier to defeat the computer
        opponent; increasing the difficulty level to 2, 3, or 4 makes it
        more difficult to defeat the computer opponent.  The difficulty
        level setting changes the number of unit replacement steps the
        computer side receives each turn.

             In order to maintain the game's historical framework as well
        as play balance, the rules for computer-opponent games differ 
        somewhat from the rules for 2-player games.  Following are the rule
        differences which apply to playing the Russian side against the
        computer.


             Computer side units may be supplied across enemy controlled
             but unoccupied squares.  There is a partial exception to
             this rule for isolated, computer controlled units.

             The computer program selects defense options for the human
             player as well as the computer player.

             All computer controlled units may receive replacements even if
             they are adjacent to enemy units.

             When playing against the computer using full intelligence keep
             in mind that computer controlled units not in contact with
             your units are not always where they appear to be.

             The game will end as soon as a Central unit possesses a Warsaw
             square or Vilna.  When playing the Central side against the
             computer, the game will end as soon as a Russian unit
             possesses Konigsberg or Danzig.

             You may not move any of the Russian infantry divisions.  These
             units are employed as immobile garrisons for the cities located 
             in the western part of the Russian empire.

             The fortress assault capability of the computer side units
             is increased.

             When playing against the computer, any of your cavalry 
             which are unsupplied at the start of your turn will be 
             destroyed.


                                                                          21


        VIII.  PROGRAM REGISTRATION

             Though the shareware version of East Front, 1914 is a complete
        game, it has been presented for evaluation purposes only.  If you
        enjoy the game and wish to keep it for more than 30 days, under 
        the terms of the shareware license you must register.  

             There are benefits to registration as the registered version is 
        a full-blown, commercial-style game provided to you at a price far 
        below that of traditionally marketed, commercial wargames.  Features    
        included in the registered version are described below:

               2-Player Game:  You play the game against another person on
                               the same computer.  One person plays the 
                               Central Powers side, the other person plays
                               the Russian side.

               E-Mail Play:    You play the game against another person at
                               a different location.  After each person 
                               plays a turn, an encrytped binary file is 
                               created.  This file is then sent on disk by
                               mail, or electronically (E-Mail), to the 
                               person playing the opposing side.

               Central Game:   You play the Central Powers side against the 
                               computer which plays the Russian side.

               Variable        For the 2-Player Game and E-Mail Play each 
               Set Up:         player may redeploy the available units prior
                               to the start of the game.
        
        Registered users also receive an instruction booklet and 
        schematic chart of the gameboard map (suitable for 
        photocopying).
