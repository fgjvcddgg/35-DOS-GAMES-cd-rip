This is the latest version of Sokoban.  I listened to your suggestions and
complaints and this is the result.  

I got rid of the ticking clock.  I added a puzzle preview so you can get a 
thumbnail preview of what the puzzle looks like.   You can no take back your 
last move, or maybe I should say keystroke.  This still won't help you if 
you get in to much of a hurry.   You can now tell if a puzzle has been solved 
because if it has, it will say so under the puzzle name.

Sorry, I did not...nor will I, add the ability to move the pawn with the mouse.  

Press M to simplify the puzzle board.  This is a toggle switch, pressing M 
again put's it back in Klingon Mode (My son's gave it that name)

Hardware Requirements:

286 or better with VGA monitor, a keyboard would be nice too


What is Sokoban?

Sokoban is Japanese for "warehouse man".  In Sokoban puzzles you must generally
push a number of boxes around the screen to a designated position.  The key
word here is push.  In Sokoban puzzles that is the only way you can move any
box.  You must push it to its' destination.  


What's the object of the Sokoban game?

Push all boxes n the board to the designated storage positions before time
runs out.  You can only push one box at a time.  Be careful you don't push
a box into a corner where you can't get it out.

Boxes may be pushed one at a time and only on plain tiles.
