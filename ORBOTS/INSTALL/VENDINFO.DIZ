===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

This package contains ORBOTS the Game, by Sunshower Systems Inc.
This document contains only a brief description of the package and its
features, along with instructions for its installation.  Quite detailed
documentation is included in the package, but it is in archived form, and
is more easily read after installation.

To obtain the latest version of ORBOTS Go PIKAPRO on Compuserve or visit
http:\\www.pik.com\index.html on the internet.

ORBOTS is a shareware program.  This evaluation version includes
all features of the program, and is not crippled in any way.  You may
use it for up to 30 days, without charge (see gamehelp.DOC for more
details).  If you like the program, and wish to continue its use after
this evaluation period, you are required to pay for the program (see
ORDER.TXT for more details).  Any fee you may have paid to others
(disk vendors, dealers, etc.) to obtain this evaluation version was a
fee for their copying and distribution services, rather than a payment
for continued use of the program.



===== Packing List =====================================

following files in addition to this VENDINFO.DIZ:

        Filename      Size     Date       Time     CRC32
       ORBOTS.1    1297674  15-Dec-1995  01:10a   BDBCE5A2

      INSTALL.FIL     3283  15-Dec-1995  01:10a   93DD469D


===== Installation =====================================

The installation procedure for ORBOTS is quite simple.  The
package includes a program, "INSTALL.EXE", which automates the
entire process.  You will need about 2 meg of available disk space
on the hard drive on which you plan to install ORBOTS.

The exact steps you need to take will depend on how you received
ORBOTS the Game.


INSTALLING FROM DISKETTES

To install from diskette(s), you need to perform the following steps.

   o  Place ORBOTS distribution diskette "Disk 1" in the
      appropriate diskette drive.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program on the distribution diskette.
      For example, if the distribution diskette is on drive A:, type
      the MS-DOS command, "a:install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The
      program will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy
      the game files to that directory.
      It will make no other changes;  specifically, it will not
      modify your autoexec.bat or config.sys files.


INSTALLING FROM A HARD DRIVE

If you downloaded ORBOTS from a BBS (or received it in the form of
archive files from some other source), you will need to perform the
following steps.

   o  Extract the contents of the archive file(s) in a temporary
      directory on your hard drive.  The procedure for doing this
      varies, depending on the form in which you received the package.
      In all likelihood, the fact that you are reading this text means
      that you already have the necessary tools and knowledge to
      perform this step.  If not, you should be able to obtain
      directions for this from the same source from which you received
      the package.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program which you have extracted.  For
      example, if the temporary directory into which you have extracted
      the game package is C:\TEMPDIR, you would execute the MS-DOS
      command, "c:\tempdir\install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The
      program will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy
      the game files to that directory. It will make
      no other changes; specifically, it will not modify your
      autoexec.bat or config.sys files.

When you're satisfied that the installation was successful, you should
delete the temporary directory FROM which you installed ORBOTS the Game
(C:\TEMPDIR, in the above discussion), including all its contents.


YOU'RE READY TO GO   - type 'orbots' to start the game.

Once you've complete the installation, you should consult the document
gamehelp.doc, which has been installed. That document will tell you how
to setup the program, and will give you other information you need to
properly evaluate ORBOTS.  We hope you enjoy the game.

To remove the game, simply delete all files from the ORBOTS the Game
directory.
