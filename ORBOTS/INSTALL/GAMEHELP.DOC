Overview:
---------
	Orbots the Game is a heart pounding,  brain boggling,  shoot 'em up,
	extravaganza.  Super smooth 256 color VGA graphics are complemented
	with extraordinary digital sound.  An adrenaline junkies dream!
	You must pilot the astro-chopper to defeat an invasion of half machine,
	half organo mutants from another dimension.  They have plenty of
	surprises for you, and some nasty tricks for you to figure out.  If you
	get through their defenses,  you still must face their mother ship to
	defeat them.
        Good Luck. You'll need it!  <ASP>

Chapter One:
------------
1.1 System Requirements
		The game requires an IBM compatible computer with a 386
	processor or better. A colour VGA video monitor and compatible video
	card.  It is also recommended that you have a MS compatible mouse
	(the game was designed for a mouse, but will also support a
	joystick, or the keyboard).  For sound you require a compatible
	sound card with speakers (see Chapter Two Sound Card Hoop-La for
	more details).  The game has been written to use memory wisely,
	so 640K of conventional memory is all that is required. The full game
	takes up approximately 2.5MB of hard disk drive space. You also
	must have DOS 3.3 or later.

1.2  Installation
		Please run the supplied install program to install the
	game.

	- Just type install at a dos prompt and follow the instructions.
	- The game will ask you to setup sound cards, etc.
	  when the game is started for the first time by typing 'orbots',
	  at a dos prompt.
	- To remove the game, simply delete all files from the Orbots
	  the Game directory.


1.3 File Listing
		If the game will not start or you have other problems,
	type 'setup' to automatically check the game directory for the
	proper files and to reinitialize the game again.

1.4 Memory
		To use the game with full rich sound and digital effects,
	the game requires 554K of free conventional memory and a 16-bit
	sound card. 8-bit sound cards will not work as well but are far
	superior to the PC speaker. You can check your memory by using the
	DOS "mem or mem/c" command. See your DOS reference manual for
	details. If you are not using any of the sounds or music, the game
	requires only 350K free conventional memory. To make more memory
	see section 2.5. To reset the game to min. memory see section 2.4.

Chapter Two:
------------
2.1 Using the Menu
		All the menu's in this game are easily operated with just a
	few simple keystrokes. On line help is available for most menu
	screens by pressing the 'h' key or the 'F1' key. The simple use of
	the arrow keys will move you among the available selections.  The
	enter/return key will select the option.  You may also make your
	selection by pressing the capitalized letter of the menu line.
	The 'ESC' will exit the  current menu and move you back to the
	 previous menu screen.

2.1.1 Select Episode
		The first menu screen offers the user a choice of
	adventures:  Organobots Revenge, The Plasma People, or
	Organobots Return.  The Shareware version comes with the complete
	adventure,  Organobots Revenge. For other adventures see
	Chapter five.

2.1.2 Main Menu
		This is the menu that will be used the most.  It allows the
	  following choices:

	-Fly new mission /Fly next mission - Select this option to
	  enter the world of the Organobots.  Good luck, you will need it.
	- Load/save mission - This menu option allows you to save up to
	  three games. It is wise to save the game when you have completed
	  a level because the levels do not get easier as you go.  You may
	  load any of the three saved games and continue to play from where
	  you left off.
	- Set game options - The same options available to you at install
	  time are available anytime by selecting this menu option. See
	  Install Game Options for more details.
	- Instructions - On line instructions.  It is a good idea to review
	  these instructions as needed.
	- Program credits - Well, we have to get a plug for our selves in
	  somewhere.
	- Quit  - By selecting this option you will exit the game and return
	  to DOS.
	- D -  By pressing the 'd' key you will see a demo of the game.
	- H - By pressing the 'h' key you will see the abbreviated help screen.

2.1.2  Set Game Options
		The following options are available on this menu:
	- Sound effects card - choose this option to setup your sound card
	  for the digital sound effects.
	- Music card - choose this option to setup your sound card for the
	  stereo music sound track.
	- set Volume - select this option to adjust the volume for effects
	  and music.
	- select Controller - choose this menu option to pick the controller
	  you prefer to use (and configure the controller).
	- Game difficulty - this menu option will allow you to switch
	  between the different difficulty levels.
	- Exit - return to the Main Menu
	  See install Game Options Chapter 2.2 for more details.

2.2 Install Game Options

2.2.1  Sound Effects Card
		This menu option allows you to select your sound card
	from a list of possible sound cards.
	Simply move through the list using the up/down arrow keys until you
	find the desired choice. If you do not want any digital sound
	effects select the no sound option. Depending on which card you
	have chosen from the list, another menu may appear requesting
	more information. It may ask for IRQ, DMA, and address of your
	sound card. See Sound Card Hoop-La for more details or consult
	your owners manual. If you are using one of the soundblaster
	8-bit cards or compatible try using both the SoundBlaster Pro
	and the compatible driver.  One may work better than the other
	with your card.
		Test the card by pressing the return key when the test
	option is visible. You should hear a short test sound. If you do
	not hear anything check your settings and your hardware. You may
	repeat the test as desired. If you hear only one note you probably
	have a conflict with the IRQ setting. Check that you have the
	correct IRQ for your card. If you are presented with an error
	message see Chapter four, Error messages for more details. Once
	you have completed the test, select exit to return to the Set Game
	Options Menu Screen. (note: you must run the test or driver will not
	 be installed correctly)

2.2.2  Music Card
		This menu option allows you to select your card from a list of
	music cards to find the one that is present in your computer. Simply
	move through the list using the up/down arrow keys until you find
	the desired card. If you do not want the music sound track select
	the no music option. If no music is selected there will be no music
	in the game or menu modes. Like the sound effects setup, here too
	you may be asked for more details about your card. See Sound Card
	Hoop-La for more details or consult your sound card owners manual.
	Test the card by pressing the return key when the test option is
	visible. You should hear a short test sound. If you do not hear
	anything check your settings and your hardware. You may repeat the
	test as desired. If you hear only one note you probably have a
	conflict with another device. Check that you have the correct IRQ
	for your card. If you are presented with an error message see
	Chapter four, Error messages for more details. Once you have
	completed the test select exit to return to the Set Game Options
	Menu Screen. (note: you must run the test or driver will not
	be installed correctly)

2.2.3  Set Volume
		This menu option allows you to set the volume for both the
	digital sound effects and the music sound track.  Volume varies
	greatly with the sound card used, so some experimenting may be
	required to get the exact sound level you desire.  If you find you
	are setting the volume to zero it is recommended that you select
	no sound or no music from the Sound Effects Card, Music Card
	options respectively.  The up/down arrow keys will move you between
	sound effects and music.  When you have the selected option you
	wish to change simply use the left/right arrow keys to raise or
	lower the volume.  You will see the slider move as you adjust the
	volume.  Once you have completed the adjustment press enter to
	return to the Set Game options menu.

2.2.4  Select Controller
		This menu option allows you to choose which controller
	device you will be using to play the game.  Available are: keyboard,
	mouse, and joystick.  The mouse selection also allows a sensitivity
	setting.  The joystick option asks you to calibrate the joystick
	(see Chapter Three for more details). When we tested the game
	we used the mouse.

2.2.5  Game difficulty
		This menu option allows you to switch between difficulty
	levels.
	The levels are as follows:

	Preschool   -  This is the easiest level.  As with life you should
	progress through the game starting with this level and moving up as
	your skill develops.  The enemy's weapons are just dumb bullets and
	refueling is a snap.  If you destroy a friendly ship there is only a
	small loss of points, but don't expect this to continue.

	Elementary   -  Its time to stand alone against the enemy. Refueling
	now takes a good pilot.  There are no more breaks on points for
	friendly fire.  It now takes longer to recharge your Berserker gun.

        High School  -  Now is the time to choose. Am I good enough to
	continue, or do I need more practice.

        University  -  Only a few make it to University and even fewer
	still make it through. The enemy has smarter weapons now, as they
	begin to track you down.

	Real World   -  Like the real world this is almost impossible to
	handle. The enemy's weapons are much more intelligent and will
	track you down. Some times you may just have to run for your life
	from overwhelming numbers. But remember, all the levels in the
	real world have been tested and can be completed.

2.3 Sound Card Hoop-La
		The following sound cards are supported by this version:
	ADLIB or compatible
	General Midi
	PC Internal Speaker
	SoundBlaster or compatible
	SoundBlaster Pro
	SoundBlaster 16
	MPU 401
	Roland Sound Canvas

	See 2.3.2, 2.3.3

2.3.1  Recommendations
		If you are not sure which sound card setting to choose:
	for most people, the SoundBlaster Pro setting will work the best
	for FX if you have an 8 bit sound card. It is best to try all
	the sound drivers though, because all sound cards are different.
	Try playing the game, to hear the various FX sounds with each
	driver that tests in the configuration. The music for the game
	was professionally scored, and will sound best on an MPU-401
	(Roland) sound card. Some of the richness of the music will be
	lost on other cards, especially FM synthesis cards like the
	SoundBlaster. Wave table cards generally perform much better.

2.3.2  Truth about IRQ
		The IRQ and DMA of your sound card is important to know.
	But in the configure screens, simple pressing enter when asked for
	an IRQ will select a likely default for your sound card. If the
	test sound does not complete when you run it, it is likely that
	your sound card is not configured correctly. The game will most
	likely still run, but there may be unpredictable results, as your
	selected IRQ or DMA may be used by another device. If you have
	problems, find out for sure what IRQ you are using. There are
	several programs like DOS's 'MSD' that can assist you.

2.3.3  Sound Drivers
		Sound drivers are bulky and require a lot of disk space.
	For this reason we have limited the number of available sound
	drivers for the this game. Most sound cards will emulate either the
	Sound Blaster Pro (preferred) or Adlib. A few other popular choices
        (including the lowly PC speaker - SLOW) were also thrown in.

2.4 Setup Program
		The Setup program is supplied to reset your game to default
	values. If for some reason the game is not working and you do not
	know how to correct the problem you can run the setup program.
	Simply change to the game directory and type 'setup'. The setup
	program will check to see if all the required files are present.
	If a file or files is missing, instructions will appear on the
	screen. Follow these instructions. Setup also sets the game to no
	sound card, and no music card, and keyboard controller. Don't worry
	about your high scores because they will not be lost by running
	the setup program. If setup detects a serious problem it will ask
	you to reinstall the game. At this point all high scores will be
	lost (See Installation for help on reinstalling the game).

2.5 Using a Boot Disk
		If you don't have enough memory when you start the game
	and you don't want to alter your autoexec.bat and config.sys files,
	a simple alternative is to create a boot disk.
                In the game directory (usually c:\orbots) there is a file
	called makeboot.bat. Place a floppy (formatted or unformatted)
	disk in a: drive and type MAKEBOOT. When the prompt returns
        press (ctrl alt del) and then run the game.
		If you want to run the game with a mouse driver installed,
	locate the directory where your mouse driver is. The file is
	usually called mouse.com or mouse.exe. Then using an editor
	such as edit.com or windows notepad, include the file name
	in the autoexec.bat file on the boot disk. The file would
	read as below. If the mouse driver is in the root directory
	of c: , the fourth line would read c:\mouse.
		Don't forget to select 'mouse' in the options/controller
	menu when the game is running.

	example: prompt=$p$g
		 path=c:\;c:\DOS;\c:\windows
		 c:
		 [drive:][path]\mouse
                 cd \orbots
                 orbots

Chapter Three:
--------------
3.1 Using the Keyboard
		The game may be played, using the keyboard only. You already
	know the keyboard provides the access to all the menu functions but
	you can play the game with the keyboard as well. The arrow keys
	provide the up, down, left, and right movement. Press the Alt key
	to fire the Yttrium cannon, while the Ctrl key fires the ships
	regular guns. The fire keys also work with the mouse and joystick.

3.2 Using the Mouse
		This is the most popular (we use the mouse) method of
	playing the game.  Moving the mouse controls the movement of your
	ship. The left mouse button fires your guns. The right mouse button
	fires the Yttrium cannon. When you select the mouse option from the
	Select Controller Menu you will be given a mouse sensitivity menu.
	By using the right/left arrow keys you can change the mouse
	sensitivity. There is a low, medium, and high setting available.
	Press the enter key when selection is complete to return to the Set
	Game Options Menu. On the high setting the mouse will be at the
	settings set with your mouse driver. See your mouse user manual
	for more information about your mouse settings. Remember, the
	settings for your mouse driver are usually much more sensitive
	than those in the game. So, check your driver!

3.3 Using the Joystick
		Since all joysticks are different, it is necessary to
	calibrate your joystick  Once you have selected joystick from the
	Select Controller Menu you will be asked to perform a few simple
	instructions with the joystick. If you receive a message 'Joystick
	not found' check your hardware. Do your best to move the joystick
	as you normally would. By doing this the software learns where the
	left, top, bottom, and right limits of your joystick are. If you
	find the joystick settings to be a little off you can recalibrate
	them by following this procedure again. If you find that your
	joystick is not sensitive enough, repeat the calibration procedure,
	but don't move the stick all the way to the top left and bottom
	right when asked. Moving the stick only part way, will increase
	the joysticks sensitivity in the game.
		Moving the joystick will move your ship. By pressing
	button 0 you will fire your guns. By pressing button 1 you will
	fire the Yttrium cannon.


3.4 Saving a Game
		To save a game select the Load/Save option from the Main
	Menu. Once selected the Load/Save menu will appear.  Choose the
	Save Current Game option from the Load/Save Menu.  Selecting this
	option will save the current game. This includes your current
	score, weapon status, episode, and level. You will be asked to
	select one of three possible games. This allows you to keep three
	saved games that you may return to at a later time to continue
	playing. Once a selection has been made, if that saved game exists
	it will be over written with the current game. You can only save
	between levels so save often and wisely.  If you wish to play one
	level over and over again simply save before you start playing that
	level and load that level again and again.
	- Exit - selecting this option from the Load Save Menu will return
	you to the Main Menu screen.
	Note: The games are saved in a file called 'sunshw?.sav'. You can
	copy or rename this file if you want to keep more than 3 saved
	games. To play this game, simply rename or copy to its original
	name.

3.5 Loading a Saved Game
		To load a game select the Load/Save option from the Main
	Menu. Once selected, the Load/Save menu will appear. Choose the Load
	Saved Game option from the Load/Save Menu.  Selecting this option
	will load one of the saved games. You will be asked to select one of
	three possible games. This allows you to choose which saved game you
	wish to continue playing  Once a selection has been made, if that
	saved game exists it will be loaded as the current game. You can
	only load between levels. You may reload a saved game over and over.
	Remember By loading a saved game your current game will be lost.
	- Exit - selecting this option from the Load Save Menu will return
	you to the Main Menu screen.

3.6 High Score
		After you Quit the game you will see a high score screen.
	This screen displays the top ten high scores.  If you achieved a
	high score while playing, a beep will sound and a flashing arrow
	will point to the score you obtained.  At this point you may enter
	three characters, such as your initials.  If you typed the wrong
	character, don't worry, just press the backspace key and enter the
	correct character.  Once you are satisfied press the enter key.
		The high score screen also appears when a demo is run just
	to show off your great game playing.  The screen will also appear
	every time you quit the game even if you did not beat that last
	high score.

3.7  Bonus points, Game speeds, and Cheat mode
		At the end of each level you will receive bonus points
	based on the number on enemies destroyed.  The number of
	points given will be displayed at the end of a successfully
	completed level.
		If you are a certified adrenaline junky and you find the
	game a bit slow, try starting the game by  typing 'orbots q'.
	This will start the game in quick mode, which is 50 percent
	faster than standard. (fast machine required)
		Perhaps you have a slow machine (such as a 386sx-16)
	or an old VGA graphics card.  In this case run the game in slow
	mode by typing 'orbots s'.  The game runs faster by disregarding
	some of the video information.
		If you have a registered version of the game, and you just
	can't get through that level, try starting the game by typing:
	'orbots c'.

5.1 About Shareware
	Shareware is "try it before you buy it" software.
	Use the program for 30 days and decide whether you'll ever use it
	again. Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial
	software, and the copyright holder retains all rights.
	Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
	Orbots the Game is a "shareware program" and is provided at no
	charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with
	your friends, but please do not give it away altered.
	If you find this program useful and find that you are using
	Orbots the Game, you must make a registration payment of $24.95.
	The $24.95 U.S. registration fee will license one copy for use
	on any one computer at any one time.  You must treat this software
	just like a book.  An example is that this software may be used by
	any number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
	location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
	being used at one location while it's being used at another.
	Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the
	same time. If you plan to keep the software, please pay the
	authors. These fees are small, and support some of the brightest
	programmers working today.

5.2 ASP Ombudsman Statement
        This program is produced by a member of the Association of
        Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that the
        shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve
        a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting
        the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman
        can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member,
        but does not provide technical support for members' products.
        Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon,
        MI 49442-9427 USA, FAX 616-788-2765 or send a CompuServe
        message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.
