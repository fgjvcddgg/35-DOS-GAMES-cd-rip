Program Description

Orbots the Game is a heart pounding, brain boggling, shoot 'em up,
extravaganza. Super smooth 256 color VGA graphics are complemented with
extraordinary digital sound. An adrenaline junkies dream!
You must pilot the astro-chopper to defeat an invasion of half machine,
half organo mutants from another dimension. They have plenty of surprises
for you, and some nasty tricks for you to figure out. If you get through
their defenses, you still must face their mother ship to defeat them.
Good luck. You'll need it! <ASP>
