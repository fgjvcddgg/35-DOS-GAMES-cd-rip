บ Game Configuration บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออผ
    To configure World Quest, run the wqsetup.exe program. Choose your
language by pressing either F1 or F2.  The setup program will display
a menu of choices about your system hardware and game options.
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and the enter key selects an option.
When changing the game and opening delays, press the up or down arrow
key to change the value.    

The data directory should be set to the current directory unless you are
running World Quest from a CD-ROM.  If this is the case, then set the
data directory to a drive where your configuration files and high scores
may be written.   Once you have saved your configuration in a data directory,
you should always run World Quest and the setup program from the WQ2DATA 
directory by running the following batch files:
wqsetup.bat - Runs the setup program
wqe.bat     - Runs World Quest (English version)
wqd.bat     - Runs World Quest (German version)

If you do not run the programs from this directory, they will not be able
to find your configuration for the game.

The menu looks like this:

   Play Game
Enter Level Code
  Instructions
  Ordering Info
    Credits
  High Scores
   Quit Game

(or press joystick button) to execute the option.

High scores are viewed only from the main menu. To reset the high score
table, delete the file high.sco.


After reading the info on the main menu, select start game to begin
your quest. You must venture around the surface of several planets,
in order to destroy the aliens populating the area. Once you've
secured the planet, your race can begin rebuilding its own cities.

The alien defense bases will shoot at you using various types of missiles,
which you must avoid.  Some bases are placed so you must destroy them with
a bomb.  You must use some strategy to destroy the bases with the least
amount of damage to your own ship.

To rescue a hostage, first shoot the buildings they are being held in.  They
will start running around, trying to get your attention.  To pick them up,
simply move on to them.  They will get into your ship and be transported
to your home planet.

If you only have one ship left, and your shields are below half, the screen
will begin to flash purple, as a warning that you should be more careful.

If you are using the commercial version of World Quest, press L while
playing the game for extra lives when you're in trouble.  This allows you
to play the whole game without using level codes.

บ Level Codes บ
ศอออออออออออออผ
Each level has a level code that you can enter.  If you type in a correct
code, the game will begin at that level.  Level codes are shown on the status
screen after you've finished a level.  Be using level codes, you will be
able to play all of the levels, however your score will start at 0
regardless of where you begin.
