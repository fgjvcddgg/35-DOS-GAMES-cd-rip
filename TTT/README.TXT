        The Storyline:

        You are Jack `Calculator' Hayes, a mild mannered 
        attorney.  Until one day...

        Shane Conway Computer Designs, a large company,
        is also a front for a C.I.A. base held underneath
        the building.  A secret militia group, led by 
        the mysterious Master Dinkins, takes the building
        by storm.

        As you are walking down the street to get a cappuchino
        from the local coffee shop, you hear gunfire from 
        inside the building.  Remembering all those self-defense
        classes you took in the third grade, you enter the
        building.

        Loading Instructions:

        Once the game is installed on your hard drive, you
        may load it in a multitude of ways.

        1.  Type "TT".  This will load the game without sound
        and music.  This is the proper loading procedure when
        you haven't got a sound blaster compatible sound card.

        2. Type "TT S1".  This will load the game with sound
        but without music.

        3. Type "TT T".  This will load the game with music
        but not sound.

        4. Type "GO".  This will load with music and sound.

        Playing Instructions:

        As Jack Hayes, you know a multitude of attack 
        techniques.  Actually, you know how to kick.
        Also, while outside, you may jump.  Hold down
        the 0 button until the jump meter is all the
        way up, and release.  You will shoot until the
        air.  You may also kick while in the air for a
        large attack.
